[basic desire sheet]

<br>
<br>


In the new society there exists a sheet listing all the sufferings in
which people experience. When all these sufferings are fulfilled we livea happy life but when something is missing, it creates a whole/void thatpeople wish to fill. 

<br>
<br>


This sheet is used at during public pretensions and
while setting up public policy. It allows for people to discuss if other desires should be met instead and if other means would be more suited to fulfill these desires.

<br>
<br>


To sum up, it is a checklist/sheet where one states the sufferings that
one wishes to remove by doing something (an example of such a checklist/sheet can be seen by a link displayed on the homepage of this web site).
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


[defining sound]

<br>
<br>


In the new language that this society wishes to create, [Ukku
language], there exists certain sounds that are always present at the
start of a word. 

<br>
<br>


These sounds only exist at the start of words and no where else in the words. All words in the language need to begin with one of these sounds. 
<br>
<br>


These words define the purpose of the word in the sentence. Even if you are unfamiliar with the word, you will be able to determine some basic properties of the word, simply due to which [defining sound] is used at the start of the word.


<br>
<br>


On the Homepage a link to the
rules of this language as well as basic vocabulary, is displayed

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


[fantasy computing]

<br>
<br>


Computers science plays an essential role in the world around us. The
more effective computers will get, the greater this role will be. In
order to ensure progress, every citizen is expected to have an in-depth
knowledge of computer science. This is easier said than done, as can be
seen the difficulties involved in the literacy campaigns to get people
to be able to read and write.

<br>
<br>


To assist with 'computer science literacy', there is a fictional
universe created with aim of teaching computer science to the public.
The name of this fictional universe is called [fantasy computing].
Every concept that exist in computer science is represented in this
fictional universe, as magic, goblins or whatever other concepts people
find more interesting than computer science itself. 

<br>
<br>


Then when ever they
watch a movie, read a book, etc, they will be learning these key
components and then can make use this knowledge at a later stage.

<br>
<br>


Attached to the folder that this document is in, there exists further
details. Please note that the purpose of this document is to understand
the thinking of such an ideal. In order to design a [fantasy computing] system, there needs to input from those who have both the knowledge and experience of how computers actually work and understand how normal people process/understand such information in the real world.
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


[fantasy operating system]

<br>
<br>


This is a computer based operating system that is to be designed to be
applicable to the rules set out in [fantasy computing]. Therefore,
making it accessible to the masses too be able to use it as a powerful
tool, not just to understand the surface level applications of it.

<br>
<br>


Whether the operating system is created from scratch or simply is
another per-existing operating system that has been modified, it makes
no difference. 

<br>
<br>


What is important however, is that it follows the rules
set out by [fantasy computing]. The language of this operating system
also needs to be made to be the official language of the new state.

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


[governmental assisted living program]

<br>
<br>


In the new society every citizen has the right to housing. The extent of this benefit is purely determined by cost and what the [Ukku government]s and [Ukku parliament] decide on. However, most likely these housing units will have a net positive on the economy and will be low cost hostel units.

<br>
<br>


Each person has a right to a sound proof, quiet bed for sleeping and
also have somewhere where they can store their stuff. 

<br>
<br>


With the appropriate size of such storage being the size of a large suitcase. They also should have the right to a communal shower area, bathrooms, and kitchen area.

<br>
<br>


Any person has the right to these. This is regardless of age and a
reason does not need to be giving. If a child chooses to live in one of
these, there may be extra facilities there to aid healthy development
into a responsible adult and to fight against any social stigma that mayoccur due to them living there. 

<br>
<br>


The fact that no reason is needed,
allows people living in unhealthy environments to have an escape,
without any consequences for doing so. 

<br>
<br>


For example, a child experiencing
abusive relationship can leave without needing to prove that such abuse
has taken place or needing to convince anyone. Those in relationships
containing domestic violence would be able top do the same.


<br>
<br>


Being homeless is a crime. People who do not have a home of their own
are expected to live in these facilities.


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


[groupible sound]

<br>
<br>


In the new official language of the state, the [Ukku language], sounds
are divided into different categories by how they form together, to formsyllables. 

<br>
<br>


For example, a vowel (referred to as bridging sounds), can exist between consonants. Some consonants are able to appear at the end of a syllable while at the same time being directly in front of another 2 other consonants. 

<br>
<br>


For example 's' in 'arts' These consonants are special and are referred to as a [groupible sound].

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>



[initiate a revolution]


<br>
<br>


To [initiate a revolution] is to start a formal legal process and this
is what the [revolutionary training] trains the citizens for. 

<br>
<br>


This process is designed to be used in times of political abuse of power. It is a way for the citizens to defend themselves against the state.

<br>
<br>


It is only meant to be used when necessary and is intended to prevent
the full out violence of a civil war from occurring. It is a formal
process that has other steps to be followed before violence is finally
resorted to as a last resort, when all else fails .

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


[Land of Ukku]

<br>
<br>


The [Land of Ukku] is the name giving to the new society that this
document wishes to create.

<br>
<br>



<br>
<br>


[lesson]


<br>
<br>


In the education system [lesson]s are courses that exists for a shorter duration than [subject]s. They focus on a topic that is to be learned and then once a learner has learned the thing in question, then
the [lesson] ends.



<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


[national site]


<br>
<br>


This is a website that belongs to to state that has all critical
information to the citizens, e.g. the laws of the country etc.


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


[non governmental club]


<br>
<br>


This is a legal entity created by the public and around a specif
interest in that society. The interest may be political or non politicalin nature. Once formed, this entity is recognised by law.

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


[non governmental club coalition]

<br>
<br>


This is a coalition that is formed between [non governmental club]'s
and is legally recognised as a separate legal entity. [non governmental
club]s are required to form these in order to make political decisions.


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


[permanent seat]


<br>
<br>


These are [seat]s in the [Ukku parliament]. [permanent seat]s are
[seat]s that do not change which of the three [Ukku government]s
owns them or that has some minor control over them and can be used once
per every vote.


<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


[pot]

<br>
<br>


This is savings of money that is put aside and separated from the rest,
as to be used for a specif use only.

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


[property taxes]

<br>
<br>


This is the tax people receive for owning land. Everyone who owns lands
receives this tax.

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


[revolutionary equipment]


<br>
<br>


This is any equipment that is allocated for the purpose of being used
when the citizens [initiate a revolution] and is what is used during
[revolutionary training].

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


[revolutionary training]

<br>
<br>


This is training that is giving to citizens in order to teach them how
to and when to [initiate a revolution]. Support of this training is
compulsory for all citizens living in the country. 

<br>
<br>


Citizens either need to pay a fee to get a permit to be exempt from [revolutionary training] (therefore supporting it financially) or need to participate in the [revolutionary training] it's self.

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


[seat]


<br>
<br>


A [seat] is equivalent to a vote in the [Ukku parliament]. The
number of [seat]s one has, determines the number of votes in which
they can use to vote on a decision.


<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


[subject]


<br>
<br>


A [subject] is similar to a [lesson] in the education system but is
intended to be more long term in nature. Instead of learning something
and leaving it, it is a category to help divide many different things to

<br>
<br>


be learned. They are expected to be learned throughout your time
studying that [subject]. For example, once you learned how to do
*calculus*, you are not done learning maths.

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


[temporary seat]


<br>
<br>


These are [seat]s in the [Ukku parliament]. [temporary seat]s are
[seat]s that change which [Ukku government] votes with them based on
the vote. During one vote they may belong to one of the [Ukku
government]s and then to another [Ukku government] during the next
vote. These [seat]s can be used once per every vote.

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


[Ukku day]


<br>
<br>


An [Ukku day] is 30 hours long and is the equivalent of a day used in
the new society. In the new society, time is determined by [Ukku days]
instead of normal 24 hour days.


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


[Ukku Language]

<br>
<br>


The new society has one official language and that language is a
conlang. The name giving to this language is the [Ukku Language].


<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


[Ukku Year]


<br>
<br>


900 [Ukku day]s equals a [Ukku Year]


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


[Ukku government]

<br>
<br>


The [Ukku government] refers to the 3 [Ukku government]s that exist
in the new society. The new society is divided into 3 time zones and
each time zone has it's own [Ukku government]. They are the governments that run the country.

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


[Ukku parliament]

<br>
<br>


The [Ukku parliament] is a political organisation that allows the 3
[Ukku government]s to make joined decisions where necessary.

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


[volatile seat]


<br>
<br>


These are [seat]s in the [Ukku parliament] that cannot be used once
per every vote, but instead once after a certain number of votes, after
being used previously. In other words, after they have been used, one
needs to wait for a few votes to pass before they are allowed to be used
again.

<p style="font-size: 27px;">


<b>Why it is essential for us to create a new society, following the guidelines outlined in this document
</p>
</b>


<br>
<br>
<br>
    

<b>   Our main goal</b>


<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>



The purpose of creating a new society is to improve progress and
development. Think about the worst thing in your life. What is it? At
any giving moment there is at least one thing you experience that causesyou great pain, possible even a few things. 


<br>
<br>


This feeling is called suffering and is shared by everyone. Your suffering has a cure. Due to the existence of suffering, the victims, hence all of us, worked together to fight this feeling. The way this is done is by progressing and developing in the world around us. To remove all suffering is only a fantasy. Instead we need to remove it wherever and whenever possible.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Progress and development</b>


<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


It is clear the society progresses/improves over time in terms of it's
knowledge and technology. The terms 'progression' and 'improvement' are
vague but none the less, are sufficient to describe this process
effectively.

<br>
<br>


One may be cautious of the above, since it's not always the case that
with time comes further progression. 
<br>
<br>


None the less, it is clear that as a whole, the further back in time you go, the less advanced the knowledge and technology is. It also appears that this trend is likely to continue well into the future.

<br>
<br>


<b>   How we govern ourselves: an analyses of political technology and political knowledge </b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


However, despite the above trend, not all this progression is created
equally. There is one area where progress has been slow and this is for
political technology and political knowledge.


<br>
<br>


Despite the fact the political systems have changed, for the most part
'political technology' faces resistance when progression arises. 

<br>
<br>
 

By nature, large organisations will behave in a manor that ensures thei
own survival. Therefore any change to the political system, will be seenas a threat to the organisations that are surviving off that system.


<br>
<br>


These circumstances make it difficult to seek knowledge, as the seeking
of that knowledge has real world ramifications. 

<br>
<br>


The organisations are incentivised to ensure that it is difficult to find and seek for the truth. They will also spread/support non truths that aid in their own survival. When one creates technology and seeks knowledge, that is non-political in nature, they do not face the resistance mentioned
above.


<br>
<br>


The result is a struggle that occurs between the people and the organisations ruling the system. Violence is the result of systems breaking down. Violence will occur if the organisations are successful in their goal to prevent political progression.


<br>
<br>


The final result is that these systems get changed due to violent
revolutions and violence is the perfect breeding ground for chaos to
occur. 

<br>
<br>


As further systems break down, further violence is created.
Therefore political change becomes disruptive and many innocent people
suffer.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Creating a political revolution</b>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


Real change cannot occur from within the political system without creating destructive disruptions. Any attempt to change the system from within, without the use of violence, is ineffective. 

<br>
<br>


It is like one sheep, trying to sweet talk two wolves, into having pity for it. The changes that result from such talks are watered down from the original ideals that they once were and therefore progression is restricted.


<br>
<br>


We need to create a new political system that is completely separate
from the existing one. Once this has happened, the better system will
out-compete the current systems and therefore replace it. The success of
<br>
<br>


a nation is not determined by the wealth it has stored, or by the
resources it owns, but instead is determined by which political systems
exist inside of it.

<br>
<br>


<b>   The 3 aims of the new society</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>



1) to allow for a changes in the political system to be enforced and
tested, which one is not currently able to do within the political
systems existing today.


<br>
<br>


2) to create a society where political change can occur with less
resistance. Therefore allowing political technology and political knowledge to progress and catch up with the progression of other knowledges and technologies

<br>
<br>


3) to be an escape for those who are the victims of unfortunate circumstances or those who have made bad decisions in their lives

<br>
<br>


<b>   Beliefs that are assumed to be true </b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


1) that people can live a normal health	y lifesotyle, living a 30 hour day if the 2 points below are met (this is regardless of the sun light that they get)

 
<br>
<br>

1. have a longer sleeping period of 10 hours in total (depending on the
person, they may need a 15-20 min nap in the day between as well)


<br>
<br>


2. have the the ability to block out sunlight while sleeping, thus
allowing them to sleep throughout the day light

<br>
<br>


2) the cure for most anti-social behavior and extremist political/religious leanings, is to ensure that people have strong social groups that they are part of and draw strength from when things become difficult. 

<br>
<br>


Without a strong, reliable, social net, hence by isolating them, you change who they are as people. 

<br>
<br>


They become more likely to participate in anti-social behavior and engage in extremist political/religious ideology.

<br>
<br>


3) 'changing shift' workers and night shift workers are those greatest at risk of isolation, due to the fact that their work erodes their ability to form and maintain the strong social nets that one needs in order tohave meaningful relationships.

<br>
<br>


4) that despite the fact that it is not always true that society will
progress it's technology and knowledge over time, as a whole it has doneso and continues to do that.

<br>
<br>


5) political technology and political knowledge has progressed at a muchslower rate than the other knowledges and technologies

<br>
<br>


6) this (the reason for 5) is because of the fact that progress is resisted by the groups/organisations benefiting from the existing systems, bytheir resistance to changes that threatens their won survival.


<br>
<br>


7) violence is the final outcome if these groups/organisations are
effective in it's goal to resist change, and violence will keep
occurring until the change finally occurs.


<br>
<br>


8) the outbreak of violence, can be viewed through the lens of what happens when all systems breaks down.

<br>
<br>

			
9) when people form together to create organisations, these organisations start forming a behavior that is disconnected from the aims and objectives of the people running those organisations. The objective of an organisation becomes to survive as an organisation.

<br>
<br>


There may be some exceptions created by the systems within the
organisations. For example, a public company will become more interestedin the shareholders who vote in the leadership for the purpose of
raising share prices. 

<br>
<br>


They wish to sell those shares at a profit and never hear from the company again. The people vote in someone who's job it is not to care about the company's future survival and instead to only care about the share prices. 

<br>
<br>


They will be happy to vote in someone who runs the company into the ground if it means that they can sell
their share prices at a profit and leave before the end occurs. 

<br>
<br>


However,the people who make up that company, will create an interest of
survival. Therefore the same objective exists, it simply just exist
within opposition to the share holders objective. 

<br>
<br>


Therefore, such companies behave as a result of constantly needing to resolve these two contradictions.

<br>
<br>


10) violence breeds violence.

<br>
<br>


11) this is because violence create chaos and violence occurs when all else breaks down. Therefore this chaos leads to further violence.

<br>
<br>


12) violence is removed once strong systems have been put in place.

<br>
<br>


13) the success of a nation is not determined by the wealth it has stored, or by the resources it owns but by the political systems it has.


<br>
<br>


14) people are more similar that different (in other words, you are not
significantly unique.) Therefore you can assume within reason, that whatis applicable for one person will be exactly applicable to another.


<br>
<br>


15) differences are superficial and mostly occur due to people sharing
different life experiences.

<br>
<br>


16) following from the two above, we can conclude that all people experience the same basic desires and sufferings. 


<br>
<br>


Therefore, the society will need to paint all of the citizens with a broad brush and assist them in
improving their lives by a 'one size fits all' approach. This is in
opposition to wasting resources to assist people on individual needs.


<br>
<br>


17) change is bad. It disrupts systems and always causes harm.

<br>
<br>


18) despite 'change' being bad, change always occurs and attempts to resist
change often do more harm than good.

<br>
<br>


19) change is also essential for progress. In order to get from where you are to where you want to be, change has to occur. 

<br>
<br>


However, change should be kept to what is necessary, using as much of the pre-existing systems as possible.

<br>
<br>


20) attempts done to reform the system from within will resemble the system that they are reforming. Therefore there still will exist the same toxic elements of the old system. 

<br>
<br>


This is because their exists old
pre-existing structures and society will try to re-organise it's self tomatch/copy the previous structures put in place.


<br>
<br>


21) even in absolute dictatorships, true power lies in the hands of the
masses. The key different is the transparency of institutions and the
encouragement of public participation in the political process. 

<br>
<br>


Regimes use censorship and other means to try to control the public, as to maintain their own survival.


<br>
<br>


22) when somebody receives passive income, income without contributing
labor, they are taking from the economy. Unless they find a way to
somehow give value back in return, of what they are extracting, this
will strain the economy. 


<br>
<br>

For example, rent creates old income without producing anything productive to the economy. The underprivileged end up becoming the slaves for the elites.


<br>
<br>


23) market forces are complex and any attempt to prevent it from crashing is to simply waste resources. Instead another safety net is needed, a
second economy needs to be put in place for when the first one fails.


<br>
<br>


24) the beliefs people hold are, more often than not, determined not by what
is true but by the nature of the environment around them.

<br>
<br>


25) transparency is important to be maintained by those who make decisions on how the state is run. Secrecy/confidentiality is a contradiction to transparency and therefore shouldn't be allowed.

<br>
<br>


26) in order to conduct talks effectively between parties, you need to
expose the true intentions/desires of the parties conducting the talks. Only once their true intentions/desires are made public, will talks be
effective.

<br>
<br>


27) when teaching, smaller classes do not necessary lead to better teaching environments. As long as those who need help are able to get it, big classes are fine.


<br>
<br>


28) excluding people to interact with mostly people of their own age group (instead of allowing for a more organic form of community) creates
social problems. 

<br>
<br>


This is due to their social net around them being weak, as opposed to them having a strong sense of community, with the greater community around them. An example of this is, making kids spend most of their day in a classroom with other kids their own age or at home. 


<br>
<br>

This isolates them to spend most of their time with their own age group and the few family members they live with.

<br>
<br>

<b>   The implications of these beliefs </b>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


The document was written based on the assumption that the beliefs statedabove are true. Some ideals of the document are directly linked to such
ideals. 

<br>
<br>


If one of these beliefs are proved to be wrong, then that means
that some of the ideals in this document will need to be looked into
and adjusted for.


<br>
<br>

It will be important as time goes on, to add on to these beliefs. The
methods of recording such fundamental beliefs, that other beliefs are
build onto, needs to be improved with time. 

<br>
<br>


A tree diagram may be neede
at a later stage to show how such fundamental beliefs shape other
beliefs/ideals and which other beliefs/ideals depend on them.

<br>
<br>

<p style="font-size: 27px;">

<b>How must we go about creating a new society
</p>
</b>

<br>
<br>
<br>


<b>   The question of land </b>


<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


In theory a new society can be created with no need of land belonging tothe new society. 

<br>
<br>


Due to the means of technology enabling collaborating over long distances, the need for physical land becomes obsolete.

<br>
<br>


However, some challenges need to be overcome in order to put theory to
practice.

<br>
<br>


1) the clashing of legal systems


<br>
<br>


The new society that exists without borders will result in people livingwithin other countries, also to form part of this new society. 

<br>
<br>


It therefore becomes challenging for the new society to make laws as there already exists laws in the countries where people live.

<br>
<br>


2) the troubles involved with enforcing laws and collecting taxes

<br>
<br>


What happens if people do not abide by those laws or do not pay tax. It
becomes difficult both due to the distances involved and the legal
concerns (due to being in separate countries) to have a body to enforce
these.

<br>
<br>


One also needs to ask, even if a government allows for this, who can optin and out. If someone becomes a citizen in normal circumstances they
pay tax while living in the country.

<br>
<br>


If someone is part of the new society while living overseas, there runs the risk that they may opt-outof participating whenever best suits them. 

<br>
<br>


Do you make it so that once acitizen you pay for life? Make that if you opt out, your citizenship is removed completely? How do prevent this from happening?

<br>
<br>


3) isolation

<br>
<br>


People will mix with people living in their own countries and this
creates further complications as they will be closer to the people of
their own country than they would be to the other citizens of the new
society.

<br>
<br>


4) logistics of large distances

<br>
<br>


Large distances and complications with dealing with many different
countries, make it difficult to implement infrastructure projects. 

<br>
<br>


This means things like health care, public transportation etc will be
difficult to be provided to the citizens of the new society.

<br>
<br>


<b> The ideal </b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Due to the 4 reasons above, if a new society is to exist without owning
sovereign land, then it would be best for it to only exist within a small confined area, spanning only 1 or 2 countries. 

<br>
<br>


However, it appears that it would be preferable for the existence of a new society, that it has it's own sovereign land.

<br>
<br>


It is also ideal if this land doesn't have any natural resources (e.g.
gold, oil etc) as these attract foreign interference and destabilise
political systems.

<br>
<br>


Ideally, their should be no other people already present on the land.
However, if there is then, the poorer/worse off, the better. This is for two reasons

<br>
<br>


1) if the new society goes wrong the impact will have a less severe
effect on people who already experience political instability

<br>
<br>


2) these people are less likely to resist as problems seem less severe
and even moderate improvements will be welcomed

<br>
<br>


<b>   The steps involved in creating the new society</b>

<br>
<br>


1) awareness: spread awareness of the new society and the essential
details about it

<br>
<br>


2) ridicule: making improvements based on the criticism of others

<br>
<br>


3) create proto-government: a group of people who will work together to
achieve this goal (Members may be part of registered political parties
which exist only with the goal of creating the new society mentioned in
this document. 

<br>
<br>


Such political organisation exist within a normal democratic system and despite these parties having the same final objective, the members must operate the proto-government with the interests of the proto-government, not from the interest of the political parties registered in already existing countries)

<br>
<br>


4) create a game plan: plan what needs to be done, how it will be done
and list what requirements are needed (e.g. costs involved etc)

<br>
<br>


5) create [Ukku Language] speakers: create a group online where
people only communicate in the [Ukku Language] (the details of this
language is explained later in the document)

<br>
<br>


6) give citizenship: the requirements of citizenship are explained
later in this document and apply even before the country is officially
founded	

<br>
<br>


7) create official government: this government should consist of some
of the old members of the previous government and some new members


<br>
<br>


8) edit game plan: analyse game plan again and make changes if
necessary

<br>
<br>


9) plan for land: develop a strategy for how the new society will
acquire land for it's self


<br>
<br>


10) get sovereign land for the new society

<br>
<br>


11) implement new society: ensure that the sovereignty is respected and
get people to start living and working on the land

<br>
<br>


12) ensure sufficient infrastructure: like roads, etc

<br>
<br>


13) make adjustments to the government: remove some people and add
other people if needed

<br>
<br>


After these steps, the country can carry on with the process of running
it's self.


<br>
<br>

<b>   The tendency to be Wasteful when using resources</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


It is natural for people to try to use resources not based upon each
according to their need, but based upon each according to their
capacity. 

<br>
<br>


For example, one will fill all the space of a room, use the
exact time giving to complete a task. The size of the room or the lengt
of time giving, determines how much resources we feel we should use. 

<br>
<br>


The bigger the size the room, the more things we need to full it with. The more time giving, the longer we will take to full up the time giving to us.

<br>
<br>


This is a problem and the new government should be aware of this
problem. To prevent this, resources should be looked into (e.g. time,
money, etc) and analysed to determined what the 'real' need would be andif the government are falling in line with those needs.

<br>
<br>


For example, the masses of a society may be preoccupied with food waste
produced by a particular company and forget that the company is providedmuch more food to the people of the country, than it is throwing away.

<br>
<br>


Therefore, the chucking away of fresh food would not be a concern in
this example. Another thing to consider is even if you have a restaurantthrowing away food, the value they produce may be greater than the food
in which they are disposing of. Therefore, there wastefulness is not a
problem to anyone. 

<br>
<br>


Instead of asking of resources are being wasted, we need to start asking who is effected by the wastefulness, and if anyone, to what extent are they effected.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Details of what the new society must be like</b>



<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


The new society that is to be created is not to match the ideals put
forward in this document. This document describes the process and the
beginning of the new society. 


<br>
<br>

However, in reality, it is up to thepeople of the society to challenge these ideals and build on them to
create a new society.			

<br>
<br>


These ideals are only a blue print, and it is only once such a blue
print can be tried and tested can people decide on the type of society
that they wish to live in.

<br>
<br>

<p style="font-size: 27px;">


<b>Key traits of new society
</p>
</b>

<br>
<br>
<br>


<b>   the [Land of Ukku]</b>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

	
The new society throughout this document will be referred to as the
[Land of Ukku]

<br>
<br>


<b>   Units of measurement in the [Land of Ukku]</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


In the [Land of Ukku] the official language is the [Ukku Language].
This language has a number system build into it and that number system
works on a base of 900. 

<br>
<br>


Everything in the [Land of Ukku] is measured based on units
of 900 (as opposed to units of 10.) For example, 900 [Ukku day]s to
make up an [Ukku Year], 900 meters, etc. 

<br>
<br>


Clearly this means that these
will be different to the normal values we know in a decimal based
system. In order to limit complications as much as possible, a common
unit must be found and shared wherever possible/practical.

<br>
<br>


For example, 1 meter is the same unit of measurement as 1 meter in the decimal, system

<br>
<br>


1 kg is the same unit of measurement as 1km in the decimal system

<br>
<br>


AD/BCE, 0 ad is the same date as 0 AD in the decimal system

<br>
<br>


1 Degree Kelvin is the same temperature as 1 degree kelvin in the
decimal system

<br>
<br>


There is no equivalent beyond this common unit, for example, one would
not say for two years or 3 km but literally translated will say for 2
'900 days' or 3 '900m'. 

<br>
<br>


To keep things simpler, the term [Ukku Year] will be used in this document when describing time. This is despite the fact that citizens would not refer to an [Ukku Year] but instead would refer to 900 days.

<br>
<br>


<b>   3 time zones</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


1 [Ukku day] is made up of 30 hours (normal hours as you are use to).
As you may be aware, a normal day consists of only 24 hours.

<br>
<br>


 This means that an [Ukku days] is 6 hours out of sink with a normal cycle of the day. Due to this, people will both get to experience the day, dawn and night as part of their daily lives. The distinction between night workers and day workers will not exist.

<br>
<br>


People are expected to live based on this cycle, and have 10 hours to
sleep and 20 hours to themselves. There exist three time zones within
the [Land of Ukku], based upon when in the 30 hours days, they use for
sleeping. 


<br>
<br>


1 group sleeps at the start of the day, the other in the
middle and the third sleeps in the end of the day. This allows for
further productivity as a society, for three major reasons

<br>
<br>


1) time zone differences do not exist between different parts of the
world as the time a day is measured in exists independently from the
day/night cycle

<br>
<br>


2) due to the 3 time zone existing, no extra costs or extra planning
needs to be considered for night shifts, as no one needs to be payed
extra to do night shifts. 

<br>
<br>


Also productivity does not drop as a result ofworker tiredness/frustration/sabotage due to needing to work anti-social
hours


<br>
<br>


3) more things will be open for 24/7 which has a direct economic
impact. Plus this makes it easier for planning. Businesses do not need
to focus on what hours a supplier will be open.


<br>
<br>


4) less resources will be wasted. Less resources, e.g. land, need to be
used as they do not go wasted at night. 

<br>
<br>


For example, office parking can
be more evenly distributed or low cost housing can offer shared kitchensfor people/living areas with people from different time zones. 

<br>
<br>


Although not to be desired by everyone, it may allow many people to save costs without needing to give up their privacy

<br>
<br>


5) Traffic will be more evenly distributed. Therefore there are less
traffic jams, less money spent on making more roads for peak hour
traffic, etc.

<br>
<br>


Another example is that public transportation can carry on running
throughout the night. This helps to cover the cost of large
infrastructure projects.

<br>
<br>


6) Preventing anti-social behavior/extremist political/religious
leanings caused by the psychological side effects caused by isolation.
'Changing shift' workers and night shift workers in a normal society
would be disconnected from a social safety net.

<br>
<br>


 It's a hard pill to swallow, but the reality is that this work isolates people. This isolation has unhealthy side effects that is unhealthy both for the people effected and to the society they contribute to. 

<br>
<br>


By removing these workers from society, the [Land of Ukku] manages to remove the social problems that come with this type of work.

<br>
<br>


One may wonder if such a set up would be natural. The term 'natural' is
pretty arbitrary but if one wishes to know if ever in the history of our
<br>
<br>


species, has such sleeping patterns ever existed, the simple answer would be no. As with the rest of the recommendations in this document, they
are part of something new, something that has not been done before.


<br>
<br>


However, the successfulness of something is not determined by it's
previous history. Yes, the previous history gives you an indication of
success or failure but it is not the only thing which you need to
analyse. This is especially true when such a 'history' does not exist.

<br>
<br>


The important question to ask is why do we sleep. Can we still get
similar results if we keep the ratio of the sleep hours to hour awake,
changing only the time? 

<br>
<br>


What is more important than sticking to a 24 hour cycle is ensuring that we can block out light that prevents sleeping and ensure that we follow a routing of when we wake up and g
to sleep.

<br>
<br>
  

To prevent behavior that is likely to negatively effect this routine,
and therefore create sleep problems, the deadlines for work is not
determined by the end of the day but rather by the end of the work day.

<br>
<br>


This prevents people staying up at times they supposed to be sleeping,
in order to finish last minute work.

<br>
<br>


<b>   3 countries living as one</b>


<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


Each time zone is treated as it's own independent countries that just sohappen to be sharing the land together. Each have their own separate
governments that work independent to each other. 

<br>
<br>

There are 3 different time zones and therefore there are 3 different [Ukku government]s.

<br>
<br>


To be a part of the government (no matter your role or position in that
government) you do not need to be part of that time zone you represent
and you do not need to be a citizen either. Any person is eligible to be part of the government.


<br>
<br>


However, there are decisions that need to be made together (e.g. some
foreign affairs that cannot be made individually by a single [Ukku
government] alone, laws [which is the same law regardless of your time
zone], working on common infrastructure projects etc )


<br>
<br>


When it comes to these decisions there is the [Ukku parliament], which
acts as a united body of the 3 [Ukku government]s to make decisions on
their behalf.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Work life and these hours</b>


<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>



The traditional means of work would be Monday to Friday, 9 to 5. It
would therefore be tempting that think that the [Land of Ukku] would
share a similar system for it's 30 hour day.

<br>
<br>


However, this is not the case. Each time zone has 3 different working times, the first being 1.5 hours after the 10 hour sleeping period (and the work time is 3.5) hours
long, the second being 3 hours after that (and the work time is for 3
hours long), and last the third is 3.5 hours after that (and consist fo
3.5 hours).


<br>
<br>


This time structure ensures that work is done 24/7 as there is always
someone who works during that period of time, and ensures that people
have enough time to travel to other work and to get up in the morning
and go to bed.

<br>
<br>



Due to the fact that the work days are shorter, one does not receive
breaks during this period. Shorter work periods ensure more
productivity. Productivity is further increased due to fact that people
can have different jobs, which increases competition in the job market
as employees do not need to resign to test out other jobs and therefor
can more freely make demands to their employers. 


<br>
<br>


It also allows for people to test out working in entirely new fields, study something new, and encourages entrepreneurship by removing the burden faced on the economy when people either fail to do so or leave their work and fail once they try to do so.
<br>
<br>
 

Workers also may be able to explore work they like and do not like. They are free to make their own decisions on salary and the nature of the work. 

<br>
<br>


Workers therefore will be happier and happier workers contribute positively to the economy, due to the fact
that less social problems occur and deceases poor work/sabotage from
workers.

<br>
<br>


This increased productivity will result in a net positive, even as some
may, out of their own free will, choose to work less and only work 1 of
these 3 time periods in a day.

<br>
<br>


These work times are further split into 2 sections, as workers get half
of time off. A person works for 225 [Ukku day]s and then has the next
225 [Ukku day]s off. 

<br>
<br>


Another person has off for 225 [Ukku day]s and starts working once the initial person starts their time off. That way there is always somebody to work.

<br>
<br>


You, the reader, may be concerned that long period of rest will result
in negative effects for the economy. However, as mentioned before, many
will spend their time off on activities that contribute to the economy,
e.g. studying. 

<br>
<br>


It is also worth noting that the traditional model requires that employees request holidays. This creates instability, which isn't good for the economy, as it requires further planning. With the work times in the [Land of Ukku] a worker will only get holiday time off work in exceptional circumstances, as they have 225 [Ukkuday]s off for that period.


<br>
<br>


<b>   [basic desire sheet]</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


In the [Land of Ukku] there exists a sheet listen all the sufferings
in which people experience. When all these sufferings are fulfilled we
live a happy life but when something is missing, it creates a whole/voi
that people need to fill. 

<br>
<br>


This void can lead to destructive/anti-social behavior if one leaves it empty or tries to full it by other means. 

<br>
<br>


For example, one may try to replace the void created by loneliness/lack of connection suffering with another form of happiness such as food (trying to numb themselves) such as with alcohol.


<br>
<br>


There exist three reasons why it is important to patch up these holes

<br>
<br>


1. the holes create suffering to the individual

<br>
<br>


2. the hole makes it more difficult for the individual to contribute to
the society around them. For example, may cause loss productiveness at
work, loss of social connections, etc

<br>
<br>


3. anti-social/destructive behavior is the byproduct of these holes not
being dealt with.

<br>
<br>


It is therefore crucial that we can we resolve these sufferings. Public
policy is based upon the [basic desire sheet]. When discussing public
policy, one needs to use this [basic desire sheet]. 

<br>
<br>


People's behavior (whether to prevent the sufferings of others or themselves) is determined by the sufferings on this sheet and therefore it is important to identify these.

<br>
<br>


Send an email to (sandysalbego@gmail.com) should you want to see an example of what such a desire sheet would look like.

<br>
<br>

However, keep in mind that determining what should be counted in this
list as a human suffering and what should not, can be incredibly tricky.
<br>
<br>


It is likely that this list will be updated and changed with time, into
something more appropriate.

<br>
<br>


It also should be noted that more than one version of this may be used,
in order to make it user friendly. For example, you may have a picture
next to each off the sufferings, so that they are more relatable to
people.

<br>
<br>


This is so that one may understand why they are doing what they are
doing. Such a list would also be used. If people do not have a clear
vision of what suffering is being worked on, they will not have the
desire to participate/pay attention. It is also important for
meetings/political movements, as it identifies if there are any
differences in the fundamental sufferings that motivates them. Such
knowledge, before hands, prevents problems down the road. For example,
if the suffering of one party is relived by another movement, it is
likely that they will change positions.

<br>
<br>


When people list demands from the [Ukku government], it is expected
that they will not identify issues on it's own (e.g. I need to have
affordable housing costs) but make a statement and list the suffering
behind it. 

<br>
<br>


The main goal is to remove sufferings whether possible.
However, it's clearly not possible to remove all the holes present in a
person's life. 


<br>
<br>


At times, other methods may need to be resorted to. One other possible approach, would be to prevent destructive behavior, by numbing out the suffering/sufferings involved. For example, alcohol may be used in controlled medical circumstances. Instead, the patient will have the means to numb out the suffering by a professional, in a controlled environment.


<br>
<br>


I personally feel that the controlled use of behaviors involving 'self
inflicted injury', which people normally classify as 'self harm', as
well as substances such as alcohol, marijuana, morphine, opioids, etc,
would have significant effects in dealing with the three negative side
effects, left behind from the voids/holes present in a person's life.


<br>
<br>


However, such must be determined on a basis of what works and does not
work. Not by doctors, psychiatrists or psychologists, but instead
determined by a system with clear, consistent, objective rules. Tests
would need to be done. 


<br>
<br>

What should or should not be done, is to be determined by the data. It is especially important to have a data driving response to this, as otherwise, the response is likely to be
effected by people's emotions/feelings. Whether or not people feel
uncomfortable with the methods used would say nothing about how
effective they are.

<br>
<br>


Concern for the use of harmful substances such as alcohol, marijuana andpain medications, is legitimate. It is essential to ensure that abuse
does not occur. 

<br>
<br>


However, such counterarguments need to made based on the facts, not based on emotions or public sensation. To disregard life changing medication due to taboo, would greatly impact all those who are suffering as a result of it not being treated.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Last names/Family names</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>



All people in the society will be registered with 3 names once they havereceived citizenship.

<br>
<br>


The first name will be their legal name and can be anything which they
choose, as long as it is applicable to the rules of the [Ukku language] (in regards to the rules for what words can exist and in regards to starting with the [defining sound] that is used for names).


<br>
<br>


The second and third name will be the two surnames each person is
giving. The first would be the same first surname as their mother's
first surname and the second surname will be the same second surname as
theirs father's second surname. 

<br>
<br>


If their parent/parents only has on
surname then that will be the one used. If these surnames are not from the [Ukku language], then they need to be converted by the rules for converting names of different languages.
<br>
<br>


Middle names are not legally recognised. If a person does not know their parents surname (and therefore only has their own surname) then they will use that same surname for their second and third name. For example, 'John Smith Smith'

<br>
<br>



When people get married their last names do not change. A couple will
remain with different last names. However, the child's second name will
be the same second name as the mother's second name and the child's
third name will be the same third name as the father's third name.

<br>
<br>


For example,

<br>
<br>


Farther: 'Albert Koch Einstein'

<br>
<br>


Mother: 'Joanne Volant Rowling'

<br>
<br>


Child: 'Katy Volant Einstein'


<br>
<br>

<b>   The need to protect the following from being lost or polluted/corrupted</b>
   

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


1. Protecting the national language

<br>
<br>


In the [Land of Ukku] the national language is the [Ukku language].

<br>
<br>


It is important to have a common shared language, because effective
societies require people to be able to communicate freely with each
other. Therefore 'linguistic ghettos' need to be prevented.

<br>
<br>


There are 3 reasons why the [Land of Ukku] needs the [Ukku language]
specifically

<br>
<br>


1) the [Ukku language] acts as a completely neutral language. It s
not part of any language family and therefore no favoritism exists. The
native language you speak will not have a great impact on your ability
to learn the [Ukku language]

<br>
<br>


2) Consistency and simplicity exist throughout the language. There are
no exceptions. Once one learns the rules, it's easily to put complex
sentences together.


<br>
<br>


Due to the rules of the language, one can easily differentiate words, as you can tell when a new word begins. 

<br>
<br>


Also, due to the rules, one knows the nature of a new word that they've never seen before, and there are only a few 'fundamental words' that one is required to learn.

<br>
<br>


However, it should be noted that despite all this, their still exists
some challenges involved with learning this language. One needs to hear
the distinction between tones, nasal sounds and different 'R' and 'L'
sounds. However, this is the best way to create many sounds without the
learner needing to learn all the different sounds of the language. 

<br>
<br>


If a language has too little sounds, the words will need to get longer.
Longer words are difficult for learners as they need to remember more.


<br>
<br>


The language also does not use verbs in a traditional sense. Instead oneneeds to grasp the concept of imaging every word as a description, that
is describing something else. For example, describing something as 'cat
like', instead of saying that it's a cat.

<br>
<br>


3) Built into the language it's self is a means to control the tendency
of this language to divert. Therefore, even when different words are used, there still exist a fundamental core essence of shared grammar and
shared fundamental non changeable words. 

<br>
<br>


This will allow people to still be able to communicate despite the changes in the language it's self
over time and over distance.

<br>
<br>


4) the neww language has a version of speaking it that uses the speakers native languages rules while keeping the grammer of the new language.

<br>
<br>

 
Thar allows people to easily learn the language via words they know and afterwards to replace those words with words of the new language to learn it correctly.

<br>
<br>


This tweek gives this conlang a major advantage over any other
native language

<br>
<br>


Therefore the language is important to protect and due to that fact that

<br>
<br>


not many native speakers will exist globally, it runs the risk of being
wiped out and replaced by another dominate global language. To prevent
this from occurring, the [Ukku government]s and the [Ukku parliament], need to take proactive measures to ensure that the language is protected, and to ensure that it is also spoken internationally outside of the [Land of Ukku]. 


<br>
<br>


How extreme the measures will be, is determined by the risk posed to the language. If that risk appears to be non existent, they may take no action at all.

<br>
<br>

   

2. The need to protect [fantasy computing] 

<br>
<br>


Computers science plays an essential role in the world around us and themore effective computers will get, the greater this role will be. In
order to ensure progress, every citizen is expected to have an in-depth
knowledge of computer science. 

<br>
<br>


This is easier said than done, as can be seen by the difficulties involved in the literacy campaigns, to ge
people to be able to read and write.
<br>
<br>


To assist in this goal, there is a fictional universe, created with the aim of teaching computer science to the public. The name of this fictional universe is called [fantasy computing]. 

<br>
<br>


Every concept that exist in
computer science is represented in this fictional universe, as magic,
goblins or whatever people find more interesting than the computer
science itself. 

<br>
<br>


When ever they watch a movie, read a book, etc, they
will be learning these key components.

<br>
<br>


However, there are two risks to [fantasy computing]


<br>
<br>


1) many of the content that people are engaging with, may not be in
this fantasy world. Thus, people may be consuming content that won't aid
<br>
<br>


them in learning computer science

<br>
<br>


2) the rules of the fantasy may be altered/changed in the content
people engage with. This will make them no longer applicable to the realworld. 

<br>
<br>


Therefore there is a danger that people will learn incorrect information, and have no idea that it isn't applicable to real life.

<br>
<br>


There also exists some complications when dealing with higher levels of
computer science, where they are more of what the designers feel is
best, rather than fundamental rules. 

<br>
<br>


For example, software (such as an
operating system) is designed on the designers preferences, not on
predetermined rules. [fantasy computing] does extent to the software
level and as a result, software is either made from scratch to ensure
that the rules are the same (e.g. creating an operating system purely
for the [Land of Ukku]) or an alterations/modification is made to the
software to tweak it slightly to fit in line with the logical rules of
[fantasy computing] . 


<br>
<br>


For example, having windows but with the [Ukku
language] and all logic of [fantasy computing].

<br>
<br>


How extreme the protection for [fantasy computing] depends purely on
the risk of it falling out of favor to other content, or the risk of it
being changed to give false information. The greater the risk, the more
extreme the action will be to protect it.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Citizenship</b>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>



The following applies to all citizens

<br>
<br>


-they have the right to live in the [Land of Ukku]

<br>
<br>


-laws apply to them whenever inside the territory

<br>
<br>


-they also protected by these laws as well

<br>
<br>


-they have the right receive money from the [Ukku government] during
currency creation, when living inside the territory (more on how this
works later in the document)

<br>
<br>


<b>   Gaining citizenship</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


their are two paths to citizenship

<br>
<br>


1) birth

<br>
<br>


2) earning it

<br>
<br>


1. all citizens born in the [Land of Ukku] automatically get citizenship
<br>
<br>


if one of their parents are a citizen


<br>
<br>


2. to be giving citizenship you are required to complete the three
following steps.

<br>
<br>


1: pass a language test to test if you can speak/understand the [Ukku
language].

<br>
<br>


2: pass a legal test that determines if you are able to use the
[national site] to look up laws and apply what you looked up. This is
to determine that you will know the laws of the country (Later in the
document it will be explained how citizens can look up any law that
exists in the [Land of Ukku]).


<br>
<br>


3: to spend a day service in the [Land of Ukku] to learn about how
the national defense works, how to defend both yourself and your country
<br>
<br>


in times of danger, and the procedure to [initiate a revolution]. The
right to [initiate a revolution] is built into the rules of the [Land
of Ukku] (this is described in more detail later in the document.)

<br>
<br>


This is a 1 [Ukku day] training event. It also gives new citizens the
chance to meet the community and build connections, before they arrive.

<br>
<br>


4: pay a random. This a financial cost but anybody has the choice to
pay the money or to do 60 [Ukku day]s of service to the [Ukku
government]. During these 60 days, all expenses will be covered but you
will be required to do work. 


<br>
<br>


Any laziness may result in an increase of time. All work and money used from this, needs to be used for only three purposes

<br>
<br>


1* creating independence/removing reliance on others. As well as
preparing for unforeseeable circumstances. For example, growing food
internally, revolutionary training, etc

<br>
<br>


2* any cost that may occur as a result of an increased population. For
example, new infrastructure that needs to be built, if there isn't
enough water for everyone, etc

<br>
<br>


3* to spend on trying to advertise/convince others over seas to get
citizenship

<br>
<br>

4* a transportation [pot]

<br>
<br>


<b>   What is the transportation [pot] used for</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


The transportation pot is designed to allow anyone around the world to
gain access to citizenship, even if they do not have the money to get
there. 

<br>
<br>


It looks into options such as doing the 3rd and 4th requirement of citizenship, in another country. This removes the need for them to travel. It also looks into options to offer a kind of travel loan. 


<br>
<br>


They will pay a greater amount of [property taxes] until they have payed the money back, and some extra money on top of that, as well.


<br>
<br>



The amount they will need to pay back will be great, but no legal
consequences exist if they don't. For example, [property taxes] will
be double for them to pay this back, until the money for the flight plusa bit extra, is payed back into this pot.


<br>
<br>


All people who are getting citizenship, will also be giving the option
to donate to the transportation pot. This is completely voluntary.


<br>
<br>


<b>   The right for anybody to gain citizenship</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Anybody who can pass the language test (therefore can speak the
language) and pass the legal test needs to be giving the option to do
their national service and random. It does not matter who they are or
from what stretch of life they come from. 

<br>
<br>


If anybody is a criminal then
they can gain citizenship but need permission from their government to
move and may still need to serve their prison time in the Land of Ukku
if allowed to leave.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Visiting the [Land of Ukku]</b>


<br>
<br>



<br>
<br>


All tourist or anybody visiting the [Land of Ukku] needs to first gain
citizenship before they are allowed to enter the country. Tourism is notan exception to this.


<br>
<br>


<b>   Exceptions to the above</b>


<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


If someone is unable to do the above requirements due to medical reasons(e.g. someone with down syndrome) then no exception is made for them andthey simply cannot gain citizenship. 

<br>
<br>


The 3rd and 4th steps can be done by someone with physical challenges (e.g. someone in a wheal chair,
etc) and additional provisions may need to be made to assist them.

<br>

<b>The structure of the new society and it's political system

</p>
</b>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>   How [Ukku parliament] make decisions</b>

As mentioned before, the [Land of Ukku] is a Union between 3 different
time zones and therefore has three different governments, hence the 3
[Ukku government]s. The three countries have the same laws and taxes.

<br>
<br>



These laws and taxes are determined by the [Ukku parliament]. The
[Ukku parliament] is a means for the three governments to make joined
decisions together. 


<br>
<br>


It works on a vote system. How the [Ukku government]s make their own decisions is decided by each of the
governments individually.

<br>
<br>


The [Ukku parliament] is divided into 900 [permanent seat]s, 600
[temporary seat]s and 600 [volatile seat]s

<br>
<br>


Each of the 3 [Ukku government]s is allocated 200 [seat]s for
voting. That makes up 600 [seat]s altogether. Then each of the 3
[Ukku government]'s is allocated another 100 [seat]s each, in which
they can have influence over. 

<br>
<br>


All [non governmental club coalition]s can choose to opt into voting with these [seat]s. However, after the
[seat]s have been allocated to the [non governmental club coalition]s, the [Ukku government] can choose to remove any of [non governmental club coalition]'s, as long as no more than 75% of the total number of [non governmental club coalition]s groups who have opted in to vote, are excluded.

<br>
<br>
 

Who is excluded and not excluded is
decided consecutively after every 9 votes.

<br>
<br>


The [Ukku government]s get 200 [temporary seat] each. If an [Ukku
government] chooses to vote with these, then the ownership of these
seats go towards the other two [Ukku government]'s. 

<br>
<br>


Seats cannot be split in half, so only even numbers of these seats can be voted with (e.g. 2, 4, 6 etc).

<br>
<br>


Each [Ukku government] also gets 200 [volatile seat]s each, 600 altogether. These can only be used once. They will only be able to use it again after doing a further 90 votes, after the vote in which they made use of such a [seat]. 

<br>
<br>


For this reason it may be wise to use these only for what is important, not to use all of these [seat]s in one vote, as to still have these for later.


<br>
<br>

<b>   How voting works</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Firstly, a vote is done from the 900 [permanent seat] seats. Then after the result is determined, the [Ukku government]s have the chance to make use of [temporary seat]s if they wish. 


<br>
<br>


The process is not a hidden, and the other [Ukku government]s can respond to the [temporary seat]s by using their own. The only thing in which an [Ukku government] cannot do is to retract [seat]s once they have
used them. 

<br>
<br>


For example, if the other [Ukku government] decides to respond to [temporary seat]s used, by using their own [temporary seat]s, the initial [Ukku government] cannot retract the [temporary seat]s that they had just used.


<br>
<br>


When [temporary seat]s are used, it then goes to the other two [Ukku
government]s, as long as the combined total number of [temporary seat]s used by the 3 [Ukku government]s is not greater than 300. 

<br>
<br>


If the number of [temporary seat]s is greater than used 300, then 150 o
the [temporary seat]s all go to the [Ukku government]/[Ukku government]s that has the most [seat]s voting in the decision that did not occur (in other words the losing party/parties). 

<br>
<br>


The remaining left over [seat]s will be split evenly between all the parties, with any remainder that cannot be divided, going to again, the [Ukku government]/[Ukku government]s that has the most [seat]s voting in
the decision that did not occur. 

<br>
<br>


The losing party/parties is determined by the end of this vote only. Therefore, any use of [volatile seat]s
afterwards, does not effect who receives the remaining [temporary
seat]s.


<br>
<br>


The owner of the [temporary seat]s only change after the result of the
voting has been finalised.


<br>
<br>


Before the results are finalised, there exists one more opportunity to
change the result. At this moment the [Ukku government]s have a change
to use their [volatile seat]s.


<br>
<br>


Each [Ukku government] has 200 of
them. They can use as many of them as they feel appropriate. Again the
process is not a hidden, and the other [Ukku government]s can respond
to the [volatile seat]s by using their own. 

<br>
<br>


The only thing in which an
[Ukku government] cannot do is to retract [volatile seat]s once they
has used them. All [volatile seat]s that have been used, remain frozen
for 90 votes afterwards. That means that they cannot be used during
those voting times.

<br>
<br>


After this, the voting is finally finalised.

<br>
<br>


If a tie occurs, then a tie breaker vote is needed. A tie breaker vote
repeats all the three votes again. All [volatile seat]s and
[temporary seat]s return to their position of how they were, before
the first 3 votes had occurred. If the tie breaker vote results in a tie
<br>
<br>


as well, then the result of the vote becomes 'no' by default. The new
vote therefore determines who [temporary seat]s belong to and which
[volatile seat]s are frozen.

<br>
<br>


For any of the seats above there is an option to opt out of a vote, so
that the [seat] does not vote at all. For example, the [Ukku government] may choose to vote with only 100 [seat]s of it's [permanent seat]s, instead of all 200 or they may choose not to vote with any [seat]s at all.


<br>
<br>


<b>   The order bills are voted into [Ukku parliament]</b>


<br>
<br>



<br>
<br>


[Ukku parliament] only has one power and that is to vote on proposal
brought to it. Only binary proposals will be accepted to it (proposals
with a yes/no answer).

<br>
<br>


Proposals can be suggested and written up by any public person/entity
inside or outside the [Land of Ukku]. However, only two bodies have
the power to authorise proposals. These two are any of the [Ukku
government]s and any of the [non governmental club coalition]s.


<br>
<br>


Whenever a proposal is authorised, it is added to a list. This list
cannot be greater than 30 proposals. Once the list has reached 30, no
new proposals can be added until the current proposals have been voted
on. 

<br>
<br>


The ideal of the 30 number is to be 15 proposals authorised from
[non governmental club coalition]s, 5 from one of the [Ukku government]s, 5 from another [Ukku government] and 5 from the last
[Ukku government].

<br>
<br>


When the list has reached 30 and is out of sink with such an ideal ratio

<br>
<br>


(which it probably will be), favor is giving to whoever will bring back
the balance. For example, if 20 out of 30 authorised proposals are made
from the [Ukku government], then the next a [non governmental club
coalition] gets first priority when it comes towards authorising a new
proposal.


<br>
<br>


When it comes to the creation of new laws they are treated separately and the ratio is one to one. For every one vote for something related to the new law, there is another vote for something not related to a new law.


<br>
<br>


This is only applicable if both are waited to be voted on. Otherwise it
is a 1:0/0:1 ratio until something comes up to be voted on.


<br>
<br>



Keep in mind that in certain circumstances, authorising a proposal may
require more than one vote. For example, it may need to go towards
another department for review. One proposal may need more than one vote.

<br>
<br>


In such a case, voting from down in the list (of the other| proposals)
may occur (during the time that the first proposal has been sent to
another department for review.) 


<br>
<br>


However, as soon as another voting for the previous proposal, is able to begin again (e.g. if the other party has reviewed the thing being voted on) then it gets priority again. Itwill be voted on before those underneath it, in the list.


<br>
<br>


Any of the 3 [Ukku government]s can start an emergency vote, this is
only intended in times of emergency and is not intended to be used in
normal times. Such a vote can only be done by each of the [Ukku
government]s once every 1'800 [Ukku day]s.


<br>
<br>


<b>   Different departments of the [Ukku parliament]</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


There exists six separate departments of the [Ukku parliament]. They
are separate from the [Ukku parliament] but are designed to assist the
[Ukku parliament]. They help the [Ukku parliament] to function
correctly. Three of these departments are legal (involved with dealing
with the law) and three are not.

<br>
<br>



1) the three legal departments are shown below

<br>
<br>


1. the law creating department

<br>
<br>


they help to finalise into law the drafts put forward by both [Ukku
parliament] and the [non governmental club coalition]s. More detail
of this process is described later in this document, where the process
of creating new laws/changing laws, is explained

<br>
<br>


2. the prosecuting department

<br>
<br>


they investigate whether a law has been broken or not. Based on their
investigation, they will give an answer

<br>
<br>


3. the verdict department

<br>
<br>


they are responsible for preventing incorrect behavior by the citizens
and correcting such behavior when it occurs, as to prevent
re-occurrences. The police fall under this department. They also in
charge of investigating what punishments work, what alternatives exist
and their overhaul effects.


<br>
<br>


They help the law creating process together with both [Ukku
parliament] and the [non governmental club coalition]s. Again, detail
of this process is described later in this document, where the process
of creating new laws/changing laws, is explained

<br>
<br>


2) the 3 non legal departments are shown below

<br>
<br>


1. shared public infrastructure/services department

<br>
<br>


these include things like roads, water tanks etc. Some public
infrastructure/services will be owned by a single [Ukku government]
(e.g. a government may create a school where it deems this to be
important) but some other public infrastructure/services will require
cooperation between the three [Ukku government]s. For this there
exists this department to manage how these are built.

<br>
<br>


2. scientific community department

<br>
<br>


determines what is true/facts, determined by the experts in those
fields. The idea behind this is for the [Ukku government]s and [Ukku parliament] to make informed decisions
even when dealing with topics outside of their realm of knowledge. 

<br>
<br>


For
example, when deciding to use nuclear or not, this group will give the
facts about it. Nuclear scientists know more about nuclear energy, than
politicians do.

<br>
<br>


3. the public accounts department

<br>
<br>


this department is responsible for ensuring that voting is done fairly as of
the rules in [Ukku parliament] and ensures that open debate occurs.
They ensure that different sides can listen and discuss with one
another, as well as ensuring the general public can contribute to these
debates as much as possible.


<br>
<br>


<b>   The departments above</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


[Ukku parliament] has the full authority over these departments. They
are expected to create systems to allow these departments to run by
themselves. However, they aren't legally required to create such
systems. They can remove anyone or add anyone to these departs as they
see fit. This obviously needs to be done by a yes/no proposal voted by
the [Ukku parliament].

<br>
<br>

<b>   Transparency</b>



<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


One of the fundamental concepts of the [Land of Ukku] is the idea of
transparency. Secrete/classified documents are frowned upon and aren't
allowed at all for big businesses, big organisations, [Ukku
parliament], the departments of the [Ukku parliament] and the [Ukku
governments]. 


<br>
<br>


They instead need to have all such information accessible
to the public. The exact details that apply to big businesses and big
organisations can be found later in this document. For [Ukku
parliament], the departments of the [Ukku parliament] and the [Ukku
government]s, any meetings that occur need to be recorded on a video
format and audio format. These recordings need to be accessible to the
public. All documentation must also be made public. 


<br>
<br>


This even applies tomeetings with other countries, no meeting may be private and no
documentation either. To do so would be to break the law. If it is
crucial to have talks behind closed doors, then a third party may be
used to do so. However, all talks/information that the third party
provides/has with the [Ukku government], [Ukku parliament] or the
departments of the [Ukku parliament], again need to be accessible to
the public.

<br>
<br>


Officials representing the above, may not conduct such meetings in theirprivate lives either. All information needs to be made publicly
accessible. 

<br>
<br>


Any work time that occurs, also needs to be recorded. For
example, if a vote takes place in [Ukku parliament] then the video of
that needs to be made public. When an official of [Ukku government]
starts work they need to be recorded from start to finish.


<br>
<br>


[non governmental club]s are fully exempt from any legal
responsibility to commit to being transparent but to not do so is
frowned upon. However, all public money giving to [non governmental
club]s by the state, by law, needs to be made public. How the [non
governmental club]s choose to spend this money also needs to be made
publicly accessible.

<br>
<br>


[non governmental club coalition]s are partly exempt from this
process. The process of how [non governmental club]s join together to
form [non governmental club coalition]s is discussed later in the
document, but before a [non governmental club]s are allowed to
form/join a [non governmental club coalition], they need to meet the
required laws involving transparency.


<br>
<br>


There is no legal requirement for not having information accessible to
the public but all financial transactions (money going in and out of the[non governmental club] needs to be made accessible to the public and
this applies to the [non governmental club coalition]s as well.)


<br>
<br>


[non governmental club coalition]s makes decisions by a vote, by
adding the total of all it's members, and therefore such votes needs to
be publicly accessible.

<br>
<br>


What needs to be made accessible in a vote is as follows

<br>
<br>


1) who made the vote


<br>
<br>


2) their voting history


<br>
<br>

3) what [non governmental club] they are part of

<br>
<br>


4) what other [non governmental club coalition]s the [non
governmental club] is also part of


<br>
<br>


5) what other [non governmental club coalition]s the [non
governmental club] was part of in its history of existing


<br>
<br>


<b>   Publicly accessible [national site]</b>

<br>
<br>


All of the 'public information' mentioned above is accessible via a
[national site] that is accessible to anyone of the public via the
internet. On the [national site], you will find the videos, audio,
documents etc, as well as all other publicly accessible information in
regards to companies, [non governmental club coalition]s, [Ukku
governments] etc. 


<br>
<br>


The spending of big companies, big organisations, the
[non governmental club coalition]s etc is also public information. If
a new highway is built, the costs involving this highway need to be
there and this includes all salaries as well.

<br>
<br>


Also on the [national site] will be all the laws of the country. In
order to gain citizenship you need to know how to look up laws on this
[national site].

<br>
<br>


Also an explanation of all the details of the [fantasy operating
system] and [fantasy computing] will be on the [national site]

<br>
<br>


On this [national site] is a social media site, where for each citizen
of the country, an account is created with their name and both surnames.
<br>
<br>


This account cannot be removed and when they die, the account will
inform the user that the account belongs to a dead person. New accounts
can only be created by citizenship of birth or citizenship of other
means.


<br>
<br>


Anybody is accessible via this site and is intended to allow citizens to
<br>
<br>


interact with each other, even when they choose to leave the country. It
<br>
<br>


is also the means used for online voting, opinion polls, allowing
engagement via public forums to ensure public input on new laws being
introduced, etc.

<br>
<br>


Due to the function of this [national site], it is crucial to ensure
that it is not hacked. The more serious cases will be for public
information to deliberately be changed to be incorrect information and
for voting to be changed by hacking.
<br>
<br>

To prevent this, the site must be made secure and must focus on allowingpeople to access information, while limiting how people send informationto the [national site] as much as possible. 


<br>
<br>


Wherever, information can
be send by user it needs to be ensured that the type of information sentis limited and that the effects of  hack will be limited to a small
area, that will not allow access to the rest of the [national site] .


<br>
<br>


Backups also need to be made and stored constantly. These backups be
made live in emergency situations when the [national site] goes
down/is hacked.


<br>
<br>


All voting all needs to be completely transparent. You need to know
which citizen made which vote, when doing a vote online. This is to
prevent voter manipulation.

<br>
<br>


Also, voting must not be instant but a buffer time should be taken
place, as to allow people to report any hacks in their account making
them vote another way.

<br>
<br>


However, even with these measures in place, a risk still is prevalent.
All it takes is for someone's password to be discovered and then the
vote can be changed.


<br>
<br>

The solutions to this will evolve with time by trial and error, to see
what best methods work to prevent the problem from occurring. For
example, they may require that if you choose to vote, you need to send aphotograph of you holding up a code, to ensure that it was actually you
casting the vote.


<br>
<br>


To ensure that this site is easy to use, videos, pictures etc should be
available to those accessing public information. These are intended to
make sure that they are easier to understand (e.g. a new law) and the
user is giving the option to say if they want to opt in or out of these,or to leave only plain text for descriptions on the site.


<br>
<br>


<b>   Remote working</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


All voting by [Ukku parliament] can be done remotely. There is no need
for the voters to be together in the same room, as long as a video of
the voting is taken place once it occurs. Transparency still needs to bewithheld when working from a distance.

<br>
<br>


The [Ukku government] can live anywhere in the globe and no
requirement of citizenship for them to be an [Ukku government].
However, it is unlikely that someone without citizenship will end up
being part of an [Ukku government]. The same holds true for all of the
[Ukku parliament] departments.

<br>
<br>


To be part of a [non governmental club] or to form one, you do require
citizenship. However, you do not need to be living within the [Land of
Ukku] and can do all operations remotely. The only exception to this
are the certain regions represented by a [non governmental club],
these are described in greater detail later in the document. To ensure
that these clubs are representative of their community, you have to livewithin that community to be a part of those clubs.


<br>
<br>


Allowing people to contribute without citizenship, increases the skill
pool, allowing more skilled people to do the job. Therefore, it creates
a meritocracy to determine who does the work.


<br>
<br>

<b>   Political discourse</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


It is only natural for different parties to have different views and
therefore they will challenge each others views. There is a method used
to control the discourse that occurs as a result of this. Politicians,
groups etc are not expected to say what their beliefs are about the
world of reality in which we live in, but instead are required before
that, to discuss and debate the theoretical components. 


<br>
<br>


In any world
with any possibility, they discuss if something is true then something
else would be true. It is only after they have agreed to agree or
disagree on the fundamental logic, can they start transforming this
theoretical model into something more practical, by debating what facts
exist in the real world around us. For example, instead of debating if
more houses need to be built or if public money should be used else where, the government should discuss the variables involved, e.g. what
is the objective, human happiness. 

<br>
<br>


How does the government spend it's
money. What contribution would need to be made to justify that money, ifthe risk of spending that money can be determined as x. What is the
relationship between the risks and the benefit. The more of this kind of discourse is done, the better the government will become at doing this. 
<br>
<br>


Systems with exact rules will start to be created, to aid this process.

<br>
<br>


The purpose of this is to allow for more accountability to exist. It
becomes more difficult for public officials to side step mistakes or to
change the scope of what they said, in order to achieve their goals.

<br>
<br>


Instead, the scope has already been agreed upon before hand. The only
thing left to disagree on, is the facts. The conclusions about how they
should react to those facts have already been determined.

<br>
<br>


If a public official keeps changes their opinions to match his goals, hewill lose credibility

<br>
<br>


<b>   Public presentations</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


The idea of public officials doing speeches is frowned upon in the
[Land of Ukku]. Instead, they are expected to give presentations.
Presentations make use of visual aids, which helps for a wider audience
to understand what has been said and allows for more factual content to
be added. It becomes easier to digest information. 

<br>
<br>


Speeches on the other hand, tend to appeal to emotion. They are often manipulative in nature.
The goal of a public official, is to help to public, not to deceive
them.

<br>
<br>


Presentations are expected to start in the following order

<br>
<br>


1) mention the objectives of why you doing the presentation/what you hope that doing the presentation will achieve


<br>
<br>


2) list the sufferings on the [basic desire sheet] that these objectivesfall under (it may be useful to have a picture of the [basic desire
sheet] as you do this


<br>
<br>


3) state the background/context of everything

<br>
<br>


4) explain what it is, you will be doing (e.g. explaining in a presentation
why more trees need to be planting in the north of cities as opposed to
the south of cities)

<br>
<br>


5) start the presentation


<br>
<br>

<b>   Determining people's true intentions</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>

Despite the fact that transparency is expected from public officials, inreality it is more likely than not the officials will hide there true
intentions/desires. 


<br>
<br>


There is a possibility that when engaging in
governments, that their intentions/desires will be hidden. In order to
perform talks effectively, it is important to lay all intentions/desiresout on the table, for the public to see and scrutinise. 


<br>
<br>


This is not easy to do, as it is likely that the exposing of such intentions/desires, will result in negative impacts for the parties involved. Therefore it
is the responsibility of the [Ukku government] to conduct an
investigation to expose such intentions/desires, so that all future talks going forward can be conducted effectively.


<br>
<br>


As mentioned previously, all activities of the [Ukku government]s
needs to be completely transparent. That means that any investigations
into the intentions/desires of a party involved, needs to be public.

<br>
<br>


This is tricky, as it allows the other party to sabotage investigations
in real time. There are three option the [Ukku government] can use to
counteract for this.

<br>
<br>


1) they can allow third parties to do the investigation if need be, as
third parties do not have the same requirements of transparency

<br>
<br>


2) when a party claims that something is non important may look to
trying to get them to expose it, by creating situations where not
exposing it would have a greater negative impact that exposing such
secrets would

<br>
<br>


3) when a party is interested in something and pretends not to, one
option may be to just provide them with what they interested in. Then i
can be seen if their position changes. 

<br>
<br>


For example, if country wishes t
go to war with a country rich in resources and the claim it is for
'other reasons', one response may be to offer the same amount of
resources that such a war would have, for them to instead not have the
war. Therefore, looking for a change in behavior.

<br>
<br>


Clearly, as the state continues to exist, the 3 processes above will
become more developed, making them more effective.

<br>
<br>


<b>   International policy</b>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


Domestic policy takes preference to international affairs. The [Land of
Ukku] needs to ensure that it is well functioning internally, before it
is to concern its self with international affairs. It should remain
neutral to international politics, if it is facing internal difficulties.


<br>
<br>


Any external threat should be viewed through an internal perspective.
For example, if another country invades the country, the questions that
should be asked is 'why did we not have better relations with the
country in question', 'why did we not see this coming and prepare
ourselves for it' etc

<br>
<br>


This creates an environment of accountability, instead of scapegoating
things that the [Land of Ukku] has not control over.


<br>
<br>

<b>   Freedom of expression</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


In this document a distinction is made between 'freedom of speech' and
'freedom of expression'. The meaning of these terms within this documentmay be different to the meanings/intentions that may otherwise be used.
Non the less, the distinction is made to to allow for the ideals of the
document, to be easily understood.


<br>
<br>


The term 'freedom of speech' refers the ability to say as you wish
without legal consequence, while the term 'freedom of expression' is
used to refer to the ability to express any idea/opinion without any
legal consequence. 

<br>
<br>


'Freedom of expression' guarantees the right not to
be prosecuted for discussing what you believe but does not guarantee th
right to be able to say whatever you wish.

<br>
<br>


There is no freedom of speech in the [Land of Ukku] and freedom of
expression exists to some extent, but there exists two exceptions.

<br>
<br>


1) one cannot give information that is deliberately false, such as lyingduring a court hearing or lying during a job interview

<br>
<br>


2) selling/promoting something that is untrue, as truth. For example,
selling real chicken as 'vegetarian mock meat'

<br>
<br>


The first kind of exception involves the understanding that what you aresaying is wrong and actively being dishonest, while the second is in
place regardless of your beliefs. If you genuinely believe that a
chicken is a plant that grows in the ground, you still have no right to
sell it as vegetarian food.


<br>
<br>


Due to this rule, companies are not allowed to use 'vague language'.
For example, they cannot say the something is 300 grams but must say
something like, it is between 229.4 and 300.6 grams. This sounds
pedantic but in reality it creates a healthy environment, and posses
little to no burden on businesses.


<br>
<br>


Other than the above exceptions, freedom of expression exists as an
absolute. Under no circumstances may it be undermined. Ideas should be
allowed to be discussed freely.


<br>
<br>


Freedom of speech does not exist and is not something that is aimed to
be achieved. The following is illegal for anyone to do

<br>
<br>


1) one cannot command that anyone break a currently enforced law of the
[Land of Ukku] (e.g. putting up a poster telling you to	 steal things)

<br>
<br>


2) cannot threading to break the law (e.g. a death threat)

<br>
<br>


3) cannot be 'hate speech' (especially when used in terms of bullying orharassment). Keep in mind that celebrities/public figures are not exemptfrom this. Any hate speech to a celebrity/public figure, is illegal.

<br>
<br>


In this document 'hate speech' is defined as any threat of
'violence' that is not illegal in nature (e.g. spitting on someones
face)

<br>
<br>


In this document 'violence' is defined as any physical activity (so
cannot be words) that effects one's physical health [mental not included]. e.g. spitting on someone or throwing bird droppings at them causes one physical pain (emotional pain, again, not included). e.g. shocking them with an electric shock gun.

<br>
<br>


to vandalise something someone owns. e.g. to set someone's car alight.

<br>
<br>


Any speech that is a threat for any of the above violence to occur, is
considered hate speech.

<br>
<br>


With the exceptions of all of the above, freedom of speech is an
absolute and should not be restricted.

<br>
<br>


The interesting thing with the above is that some 'violent behavior' maybe legal but the threat of it may not be. For example, something like
spitting, may fall well into harassment laws. 



<br>
<br>


However, if no laws for
this are put into place, then the act of threatening to do it, is
legally speaking, worse than the act of spitting itself. If spitting
does not fall into harassment, one may be able to spit at you without
anything happening, legally speaking. 


<br>
<br>


However, if they threaten to spit
at you and don't do it, then legally they can be held accountable.
Threatening becomes worse than the crime itself

<br>
<br>



<b>   The use of power</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


The [Land of Ukku] will have certain objectives, in which it may need
to resort to using it's power. However, power should be viewed like
money, the more you spend it the less of it you have. 

<br>
<br>


Therefore, instead the rulers of the [Land of Ukku] need to be strategic in their decision making. They should only use power where necessary and use the intimidation of power, in other circumstances. 


<br>
<br>


For instance, if the [Land of Ukku] has the power to crash an economy (e.g. has a resource it can flood the market with, to disrupt prices) then it is better for this to be known and not seen. They should use threats, only when needed and with clearly defined objectives expected to be achieved by making such a threat. For to flood the market price, in this example, will only result in distrust from the market. 

<br>
<br>


The market (hence the people dependent on that market) will look for alternatives. Therefore, the power the state would have once possessed, will be lost. Any threats will also create distrust and therefore as one makes threats, others will respond to those threats accordingly.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Systems</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


The [Ukku parliament] departments and the [Ukku Governments] should
create systems to help them. Part of their job is to create
systems/rules to follow, that describe what needs to be done and who
needs to do what. Once systems exist, they can be worked upon and
improved on. 

<br>
<br>


It also allows the public to criticise and improve the [Land of Ukku], as they have something to work with. They can see what went wrong and what to fix. With time, the systems should get better and more structured.

<br>
<br>


<b>  Violence </b>


<br>
<br>



Violence is what happens when systems break down. Violence must be
avoided and therefore it is the job of the rulers, to insure that
domestically, as well as internationally, strong systems are enforced
and maintained. Power vacuums should be avoided. Attempts to change
existing systems put in place, would not be desirable. 


<br>
<br>


If it needs to bedone, it needs to be replaced by another system with strong foundations, to ensure that it does not collapse.

<br>
<br>


It therefore becomes the job of the state to ensure order and prevent
chaos. Their responsibility is to enforce order exists both internally
and for outside of it's borders. Forced co-operation, is a technique
that is expected to be used, to ensure that conflicting parties do not
fight. Allowing fighting to occur, creates the risk that the existing
power structures in place, will be broken. This technique is to be used
internally and externally.

<br>
<br>


If two parties have conflict/tension with each other, they must be
forced into working on a shared goal together: that is of more
importance than the goal in which they are at odds with each other for (the reason why that conflict/tension occurs between them.) 

<br>
<br>


It is important that the [Land of Ukku] has power at it's disposal, as to use that power to force other countries, or entities/people inside it, to work on a shared goal. This concept applies to the rulers themselves. If conflict/tension occurs, it needs to be resolved.

<br>
<br>


As the state continues it's existence, it will learn the best practices
to resolve conflicts/tensions and will create systems to aid with this.

<br>
<br>


<b>   The snake or the lion?</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


A trap that states leaders fall into, is to try to place their nation i
the spot light. They try to position themselves as the king lion of a
political jungle. Their greed for power and fame, leaves their nation
vulnerable to any hunters, who are looking to hang up a new trophy. The
sacrifices put in place to get the nation's name on the international
stage, are also, to be suffered by the citizens of such nations.


<br>
<br>


Sticking to the above metaphor, instead a state needs to be more like a
snake. Snakes are silent, only to be noticed by those looking for them.
The state needs work to achieve it's objectives, without being noticed.
Public attention should not be avoided, cause it will always be present,but they should not fall prey to participating to it. Like a snake, onl
to bite when truly needed. 

<br>
<br>


True leadership must not come from the populism and hype of public affairs, but from the ability to remain 
low profile, not to be noticed. Out of sight out of mind, they need to
only focus on achieving clearly defined goals. If people truly have the
interest, they will be the ones looking for them.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Proxy wars</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Proxy wars occur when a state funds/supports a third party to
participate in a war. This is normally done to aid in it's own
interests. Any proxy wars should be avoided, as to only be used in
extreme conditions. 

<br>
<br>


If the consequences of not doing so can be clearly identified for [Land of Ukku] and where other means of negotiations and talks can clearly be shown to have been implemented and failed, thenproxy wars may be resorted to.


<br>
<br>


Any proxy wars should be short lived, completely transparent to the
public. Along with transparency, there also needs to be a discussion of
the impact on people of both sides of the conflict. 


<br>
<br>


An appropriate amount of money also needs to be spent to rebuild the countries effectedby the conflict and to help make up for the human impact of the war. This includes repayments to those who lost loved ones due to the war.

<br>
<br>



<b>   The economy</b>


<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


The government should know the difference between destructive and
constructive passive income. The difference is that, the one is income
people receive without contributing something back the economy and the
other is when people receive income passively, but value is still being
added to the economy. They meant to promote constructive passive income
and discourage destructive passive income.


<br>
<br>


The job of the [Ukku government]s is not to interfere with the
economy. Their job is to create an environment that allows the economy
to be sustained. If the government has a concern, rather than changing
the rules of this environment (therefore harming it) they are expected
to form a part of it. 

<br>
<br>


For instance, if the government feels that a business is paying employees too little, then they can create their own state run business, to pay those employees better. Therefore creating competition for workers.


<br>
<br>


There exists only two exceptions, where regulating the economy is
allowed

<br>
<br>
.
	
1. to create more competition (e.g. to break up monopolies, for when
the anti-monopoly laws fail to be effective)


<br>
<br>


2. to stop destructive passive income or to turn that destructive
passive income into constructive passive income. When somebody receives
passive income, income without contributing labor, they are 'stealing'
from the economy. 

<br>
<br>


Unless they find a way to somehow give value back in return, of what they are extracting, this will strain the economy. The underprivileged end up becoming the slaves for the elites. For example, a tax can be made for owning land, making land owners contribute back the money they receive off people by rent.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Money supply in the economy</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


The value of money cannot be created to destroyed by manipulating the
supply of it. People not spending money only means that there is less
money in the economy and therefore the value of that money will rise.
This is healthy. 


<br>
<br>


It is not for the government to try to increase spending to boost the economy. This behavior is reckless. Instead the government is to encourage savings, as to prevent the real social conditions that occur in peoples lives, (and have real impacts on the health of the society and therefore the economy) when things go wrong
and people don't have the savings to depend on.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Stability over animal spirits</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


The spirits/investor confidence cannot be the influencing factor to
determine the health of the economy. The state has a responsibility to
ensure stability. The job of the rulers of the [Land of Ukku] is to
create an economy that unharmed by speculation. The economy needs to
instead be, focused on contributing value to others.


<br>
<br>


Part of creating a stable economy is, understanding that market forces
are complex and that any attempt to prevent it from crashing, is to
simply waste resources. Instead the economy must be allowed to crash. Itis to be expected that it would be only a matter of time before such
crashes occur.


<br>
<br>


While times are good, it is the responsibility of the [Ukku
Government]s to build a separate system to fall back on. This system
needs to be independent/detached from the complications involved with a
normal economy. During a crash, this should allow people to live a
fairly simple life. The people then simple wait out the crash, until it
begins to recover.

<br>
<br>


During a recession, it is the job of the [Ukku Government]s, to cut
it's loses and decrease spending. This is both to save money in hard
times and to remove air from the financial fire. By cutting the cash
flow (hence reducing the amount of spending that exists in an economy),
the value of the money increases. 


<br>
<br>



Therefore, this increases the desir
to chase after that money. Less money circulating assists the recovery
process needed to recover from a recession. By adding money to the
economy, you only increase the supply of the money, and therefore
decrease it's value. This only drags on the recession unnecessarily.


<br>
<br>


All natural recessions come to an end. Businesses grow to meet
unsatisfied needs/desires and then shrink/die as the needs decrease. Ho
this works in real life is complex, but the nature of how it works is
easy to be understood. There will be a time of growth and their will be
a time of recovery. 


<br>
<br>


However, sometimes what appears to be a recession,
is actually a sign of bad governance, for the economy. For example,
uncontrolled printing of money or restrictive laws that prevent
competition from occurring. If what appears to be a recession, is in
fact not a recession, but only the result of a badly run economy, then
waiting it out is ineffective. There is the risk that you will keep
waiting without an end. Instead, changes need to be made, as get the
economy to be healthy again.


<br>
<br>


<b>   Change</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Change is always bad but is needed for progression to take. One needs tochange from where you are at to where you want to be. The government
must ensure that, order is maintained during times of progression. This
is done by focusing exclusively on changing only what needs to be
changed for the purposes of the progression to take place, while leavingthe rest in place.


<br>
<br>


Like with 'power', 'change' should be thought of as a type of currency.
The more change that is required for an improvement to take place, the
more expensive the improvement is considered to be. Change its self
cannot be avoided. It should not be fought against. 


However, systems/political structures that have been weakened/destabilised after a change has occurred, need to be re-strengthen.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Handling deputes/conflicts</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


As mentioned before, in order to handle conflicts/tensions between
different parties, parties in conflict with each, must be forced to worktogether on a shared goal. This goal must allow them to work with each
other, as opposed to against each other. For example, two conflicting
regional states can be giving the responsibility to handle a festival
together.

<br>
<br>


This concept of forcing conflicting parties to work together, must also
be applied to correcting polarisation when it occurs.

<br>
<br>


When such ideological division exists during debates, where the tension
becomes divisive (e.g. such as with Brexit in the UK), it is the
responsibility of the state to fix this. 

<br>
<br>


There needs to be a debate for
another separate issue, that has opinions equally split between
ideological lines (in other words where they will be debating with the
same people they were disagreeing with on the previous issue being
discussed).

<br>
<br>


This allows for them to debate along the same side, with those they had
previously disagreed with. This creates a mentality of working together,instead of a 'us vs them' mentality. For example, they may be asked
debate whether action or drama movies are more exciting or whether a
public building should be painted green or black.


<br>
<br>


The answer of these 'mini debates' are not necessarily important. What
is important however, is the result of their existence. It is important
that we work together as a society, to make our lives better, not to
divide ourselves into ideological teams of a tribal mentality.


<br>
<br>


It therefore the job of the [Ukku government]s, the public and the
[non governmental club]s, to create rules to determine how this
philosophy will be enforced. Thus, therefore making it a reality.

<br>
<br>


<b>   The family unit</b>

<br>
<br>


Traditionally, kids are treated in the same way that one would treat a
pet or livestock. They are seen as being owned. They exist as a
possession by the parents or care givers.

<br>
<br>


However, the [Land of Ukku] deviates from this tradition. Children are
instead, owned by the state, until the age that they become aware of
their own independence.

<br>
<br>


In reality however, this is more of a philosophical concept, than
something that can be enforced. The state will not physically remove
your child from you, unless in cases of abuse. Rather, it is the
community that raises the child, with assistance from programs operated
by the state, to promote an environment to support this ideal.

<br>
<br>


The concept of transparency also applies to households. The less that i
left behind closed doors, the better. A community is designed to help
look after kids, but also designed to help with things such as domestic
violence. They are designed to get married people involved with these
communities, as opposed to isolated units, where abuse can occur.


<br>
<br>


How this is to be implemented will need to be tested and will change
with time.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Age restrictions</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


It is understandable that some activities may not be suitable for kids.
For example, those involving tattoos, pornography, alcohol etc, may not
be suited for kids. This depends on what the society determines to be
unsuitable. To want to exclude them from such is natural. However, such
isolated zones can encourage anti-social behavior. 


<br>
<br>


Too much isolation ofkids, can result in them only hanging out within their own age group. There they aren't provided with the adult supervision, that they need to properly mature. This can lead to negative traits appearing in the developmental stage.


<br>
<br>


It is the job of the [Ukku government]s and the [non governmental
club]s, to ensure that any restriction of age is limited. Encouraging
all aged events, over those restricted ones, is better. 


When age restriction occurs, it is not to be limited to only one location. For example, instead of having an adult centered movie theater, instead try to promote theaters that show adult content at certain times, and all aged content, at other times. Instead of having a club, have a
restaurant of all ages, that may host some age restricted events, from
time to time.


<br>
<br>


<b>   Accessibility of public conventions</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


With new technology will come public conventions with it. For example,
electrical socket types, wave lengths for radio stations, etc. Before
such a convention becomes accepted by the state, there needs to be
effort done to ensure that it is accessible to everyone/doesn't
discriminate. For example, the old accepted system of wiring
discriminated against people who were colour blind.


<br>
<br>


<b>   Removing comfort from the general public</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


The beliefs people hold, more often than not, are determined not by whatis true, but by the nature of the environment around them. People who
are living happy lives run the risk of becoming apolitical. The result
of this, is that they may become complacent. They may become satisfied
with the political system as it stands, without wishing to change it. 


<br>
<br>


In fact, in more severe cases, the general public may resist the proces
for a political revolution, all together. Therefore leaving unelected
governments, to have a limited power dictatorship, in the country. Thei
rule to continue indefinitely, would go against everything which the
country stands for.


<br>
<br>


In order to stop such stupidity from existing, the [Ukku government]s
and [Ukku parliament] have the right to deliberately make people's
lives unpleasant. This is to be done until they learn to start believin
in a more appropriate belief system. Violence should not be used, but
unpleasant design in infrastructure, as well as creating rules that are
designed to make day to day living frustrating, should be used to make
the public politically involved again.

<br>
<br>


<b>   [non governmental club]s</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


In the [land of Ukku] there exist [non governmental club]s. These
are groups intended to be created with a public purpose or interest in
mind. Whether political or a-political in nature, they will need to havesome purpose for their existence. They are expected to work towards thatpurpose. 


<br>
<br>


For example, A 'Harry Potter' [non governmental club] may be formed by those who are fans of 'Harry Potter' and wish to promote 'Harry Potter' stuff. A dance [non governmental club] could be created to engage with people interested in dancing.

<br>
<br>


The ability to create these [non governmental club]s, remains with the
people. It is intended that these will allow for people to organise and
socialise around interests that are important to them.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Creating a [non governmental club]</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


In the [Land of Ukku], all citizens have the right (whether they live
abroad or not) to register a draft to form a [non governmental club].
In order for a club to be formed, a draft first needs to be registered by an individual. They will decide on the purpose of the club and then a
unique number will be assigned to it. This unique number is used to
differentiated it from other [non governmental club]'s. There is no
limit to how many drafts a person may create. However, a person may onlybelong to 1 [non governmental club] and cannot join a [non governmental club] before leaving the one they are part of. 


<br>
<br>


For this reason, one cannot create a new draft while a previews draft is in existence or while being part of another [non governmental club]. I
order to create a new draft while a previous draft exists, they will
either need to, ensure that the draft becomes a [non governmental
club] or cancel the draft existing. Drafts can always be canceled
before the draft is finalised. Once finalised, a [non governmental
club] cannot be canceled, by the founder. Cancellation of a [non
governmental club] is done by the rules set out in the [non
governmental club] it's self.


<br>
<br>


In order for these drafts to become a [non governmental club], you
need enough people to join, as to allow the club to have 30 members. Theamount of members in a [non governmental club] may decrease due to
death or members choosing to leave. If the number falls below 30
members, then the [non governmental club] stops existing and becomes a
draft again. It will remain a draft until 30 or more members exist in
the club. If a [non governmental club] becomes a draft again, it still
cannot be removed by the founder.

<br>
<br>


How [non governmental club]s make decisions and are run is determined
by that draft and is updated/changed based on the rules presented in theinitial draft. Each [non governmental club] has the freedom to govern
itself however it sees fit. This includes how they choose to add/remove
new members to the [non governmental club]. How these rules are to be
changed is also determined based upon the rules in the draft.

<br>
<br>


Something to keep in mind is that it is possible that (and even expectedthat) people may have multiple interests. For example, someone may both
be interested in acting and wood work. In such a case, they may need to
choose between joining a wood work [non governmental club] or an
acting [non governmental club], since they are only legally allowed to
be a member of one.

<br>
<br>


However despite this, they may still be allowed to participate in both
and do the meetings for both. They even allowed to form part of decisionmaking process (depending on the rules that the [non governmental
club] has chosen, to run it's self.)

<br>
<br>


Members start playing a more fundamental role when it comes to running
[non governmental club coalition]s.

<br>
<br>


<b>   [non governmental club coalition]s</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


In order to have political influence, a [non governmental club] needs
to join a [non governmental club coalition] or together with other
[non governmental club]s, create a [non governmental club coalition]. Such [non governmental club coalition]s get voting rights in parliament, the ability to change/make laws (the process for this will be explained later in the document) and may get other political benefits that will determined by the [Ukku Government]s and [Ukku parliament].

<br>
<br>


Like with the formation of the [non governmental club]s, the formation
of a [non governmental club coalition] starts with a [non governmental club coalition] draft being formed. This needs to done by 1 [non governmental club]. Then there needs to be 3 or more [non governmental club]s (the founder may be₹ part of these 3) willing to be part of this coalition. 

<br>
<br>


The total amount of members of all the [non governmental club]s who are part of the [non governmental clu
coalition], needs to be 2'700 or greater.

<br>
<br>


Unlike with the existing of [non governmental club]s, there is no
limit to the number of [non governmental club coalition]s that a [non
governmental club] that can be part of. However, a draft to form a
[non governmental club coalition] can only legally be submitted once
by a [non governmental club].


<br>
<br>


Also, their needs to be 2'700, of the members of the [non governmental club]s, that form the [non governmental club coalition], who choose to write themselves off, for the ability to finalise future [non governmental club coalition]s drafts. 

<br>
<br>


The [non governmental club] will never again be allowed to form another [non governmental club coalition] draft and none of the initial 2'700 members (who chose to write themselves off, for the ability to finalise future [non governmental club coalition]s drafts.), will be allowed to finalise any drafts needed in the future to create a [non governmental club coalition].

<br>
<br>


This is intended to limit cheating by one party, who wishes to create
many [non governmental club coalition]s to use as puppets, during
voting. Instead, votes are meant to be represented by a balanced
perspective.

<br>
<br>


If a draft finds more than 2'700 members but cannot find 2'700 or more
members who haven't been part of finalising a draft before, then that
draft cannot legally be created.

<br>
<br>


Unlike with the formation of [non governmental club]s, how the [non
governmental club coalition] makes it's decisions, isn't determined by
the draft. Instead [non governmental club coalition] are governed by
rules determining what should or should not be voted on. A vote between
all the members of the [non governmental club]s, that forms the [non
governmental club coalition], is to determine the decisions made.

<br>
<br>


The rules to determine how the [non governmental club coalition]
decides what is to be voted on, is determined purely by the rules
presented in the initial draft, and changes based upon the rules
presented in that draft. These rules need to be based upon systems and
not by people making decisions. All votes of the members, need to be
yes/no questions. Each members of a [non governmental club], in the
[non governmental club coalition], are giving one vote. Here they can
choose to vote yes, no or choose not to vote at all. 

<br>
<br>


When it comes to voting in parliament, if the [non governmental club coalition] chooses to participate, then it is compulsory for the vote to be done on the question that is being asked in [Ukku parliament]. After a yes/no has been concluded, then it is compulsory with [Ukku parliament] votes, that another vote is done to determine if a refrain from vote should take place (meaning that the [non governmental club coalition] in
question will instead choose not to vote)

<br>
<br>
.

If a tie occurs or if none of the members are willing to vote, then the
vote becomes a 'no' by default and the results of the first yes/no will
be used for the vote.

<br>
<br>


The rule for how new [non governmental club]s are added or removed
from the [non governmental club coalition] is purely determined by the
rules set out in the initial draft. Any changes to the rules set out in
the initial draft need to be set out in a vote (like with any other
decision made by the [non governmental club coalition]) and then it is
up to the members to decide what changes must occur.

<br>
<br>


It is likely that many [non governmental club coalition]s will not
vote in most votes done in the [Ukku parliament]. This is because it
may be outside of their purpose for existing. For example, a group of
art [non governmental club]s may come together to form a [non
governmental club coalition] with the aim of promoting art and
protecting the rights of employees in the art business. 

<br>
<br>


Therefore they will have no interest in voting in something like whether aid needs to be sent to other countries. Instead will vote on something like, should art be taught as a compulsory subject in the education system.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Voting of [non governmental club]s in the [Ukku parliament]</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


For everything that the [Ukku parliament] vote on, each of the [non
governmental club]s are giving the option to participate in a separate
vote, that has no political consequences. Each [non governmental club]
is the giving option to vote yes or no and the total number votes is
displayed on the [national site].

<br>
<br>


Despite the fact that these votes have no political consequences, they
communicate to the public what the feelings of the [non governmentalt
club]s, who are concerned enough about the matter in question to vote
on it, are.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Taxes donated to [non governmental club]s</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


A certain percentage of everyone's property tax (more on this later, as
well just how much this property tax is) goes to this funding [non
governmental club]s. [non governmental club]s can opt in or out of
having this money. 

<br>
<br>


If they choose to accept this money, there are extra legal requirements, required in terms of transparency. These have been mentioned previously in this document in the section regarding requirements of transparency by the government. For this reason, it is possible that a [non governmental club] may make use of their legal right to opt out of receiving this public payment.


<br>
<br>


The total money contributed by the public, to this tax, is added up and
spread equally between all [non governmental club]s, based upon how
many points they have. Each [non governmental club] is assigned 2250
points by default, plus 1 extra point for each member they have in that
[non governmental club].

<br>
<br>


This is intended to allow for for larger groups, that are more likely tohave more public participation, to be encouraged. However, at the same
time, it is meant to prevent [non governmental club]s from falling
prey to the habit of adding anyone as a member, just so the they can
make more money. In theory, the 2250 default, should allow for such a
balance to exist.

<br>
<br>


However, this lump sum is also divided equally by the number of citizens(whether living abroad or not abroad) and each citizen gets a vote of
sorts on what to do with their portion of the money. Simply, if they do
not declare where they want their money to go, then it is divided based
upon the 2250 point ratio mentioned above. 


<br>
<br>


However, each citizen has the right choose which [non governmental club]'s they wish for their
portion of the money to go to.

<br>
<br>


The ideal would be for every citizen in the [Land of Ukku] to choose
things that they are passionate about and contribute this tax portion to those.

<br>
<br>


If a [non governmental club] is closed down or sent to a draft form,
due to not having enough members, then the money goes back to the
general [pot], with the '2250 point' system again.

<br>
<br>


How each person chooses for their portion of this money to be spend, is
considered public information. Therefore transparency is required. Any
citizen of the country can be looked up on the [national site] to find
out which [non governmental club] they currently choosing for the
money to go to and how much they choose to send, as well as all their
previous history, that exists for them.

<br>
<br>


On the [national site] there 3 different charts accessible to the
public

<br>
<br>


1) that shows what percentage of money each [non governmental club]
received as well as the total money they receive

<br>
<br>


2) that shows how much money each [non governmental club] received
when only looking at money that was specifically choosen by members of
the public to go to them, as well as the total number of members who
chose to give money to them.


<br>
<br>


3) the third chart is the same as number 2, but only including those
who actually contribute to this tax (i.e. land owners). The chart is of
what percentage each [non governmental club] receives, property tax
and is proportional to how much tax they pay. Contributions done by
those who pay more property tax (therefore are the ones funding more to
this fund) are weighed higher in this graph


<br>
<br>


Each of these graphs is intended to allow the public to have access to
further information. Although the third graph has no legal significance
it both gives a voice to those who pay the taxes, as well as exposes
potential divides that may exists between the third and second graph.
Such a divide could act as clue to the nature and health of the society.
<br>
<br>


<b>   Changing the purpose of existing for a [non governmental club]</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Some [non governmental club]s may be expected to self destruct after a
completed objective. For example, if you create a [non governmental
club] to create/change a law, after that law has been created/changed,
then the [non governmental club] no longer has a purpose to exist. At
this point the [non governmental club] may dissolve it's self or may
change it's purpose for existing.

<br>
<br>


A [non governmental club] may also change it's purpose for existing,
if it's internal beliefs have changed. For example, a [non governmental
club] existing to spread the ideals of communism, may have a change of
heart and become libertarian. In this case, the option exists to close
the [non governmental club]. Any [non governmental club] is allowed
to terminate it's self. The other option is, to instead, change the
purpose for the [non governmental club] existing.

<br>
<br>


Another likely reason for such a change to occur, would be a change of
interest. For example, a chess [non governmental club] may change to
include all strategy board games.

<br>
<br>


There are no limitations as to how often a group can change it's purposefor existing. However, it is an expectation that the [non governmental
club] will act according to their purpose. Therefore, there is an
expectation for the [non governmental club] to update that purpose
whenever a change occurs.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Changing the purpose of existing for a [non governmental club coalition]</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


As with [non governmental club]s, so too can [non governmental club
coalition]s change their purpose for existing. As with [non
governmental club]s, [non governmental club coalition]s also are
giving the right to be able to terminate themselves.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Permanent [non governmental club]s</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


There are some [non governmental club]s that are permanent. They exist
regardless of the amount of members. Like with the other [non
governmental club]s, you may not be a member of one of these [non
governmental club]s and be a member of another [non governmental
club], at the same time.

<br>
<br>


Like with any [non governmental club], these [non governmental
club]s still need to form part of a [non governmental club
coalition], to have political representation. However, unlike other
[non governmental club]s, they are not allowed to create drafts for
[non governmental club coalition]s.

<br>
<br>


Anybody (who isn't already part of another club) can be part of these
[non governmental club]s. Legally, nobody is allowed to be denied the
right to join one of these. The way that these clubs work, is by a vote
system (a transferable vote system, like that existing in Ireland, but
with negative voting as well) to elect 30 representatives. These 30
representatives vote on yes/no drafts, that are voted on, by the member
of the [non governmental club].


<br>
<br>


 The vote for the 30 members is don
every 30 [Ukku day]s. When a yes/no vote is voting on, the members need to be informed on what they are voting on. There needs to be much debate and discussion between the members, before voting begins.

<br>
<br>


After the vote has been done, then another two votes need to be done. Ifall 3 votes have the same outcome, then the club acts accordingly.
However, if one of the three votes, have a different result, then the
process needs to start over again. The decision to start the vote over
again, or to instead vote on something else, is decided by the elected
30 members. 

<br>
<br>


This process is deliberately designed to be slow, resulting in more long term decisions being made, from these clubs.

<br>
<br>


The only exception to this, is voting for [Ukku parliament]. The
decision to participate or not, in a [Ukku parliament] vote is determined by one vote. 


<br>
<br>


For actual voting in [Ukku parliament], one vote is done and then another vote is done. If the two votes contradict each other, then a third final vote needs to be done. After a result is determined, then a final vote is done to determine whether the [non governmental club] should choose to not vote at all.

<br>
<br>


As before, any ties result in 'no' being determined as the result, by
default.


<br>
<br>


<b>   All the Permanent [non governmental club]s</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Below is a list of all the Permanent [non governmental club]s that
exist in the [Land of Ukku]


<br>
<br>


1. education

<br>
<br>


A [non governmental club] with the purpose of looking after education
in the [Land of Ukku]

<br>
<br>


2. fair competition

<br>
<br>


A [non governmental club] with the purpose of ensuring there is
competition between people employing others, competition between people
applying for jobs, and competition for goods/services in the market.

<br>
<br>


3. the economy

<br>
<br>


A [non governmental club] with the purpose of ensuring that the
economy works.

<br>
<br>


4. emergency

<br>
<br>


A [non governmental club] with the purpose of preparing for emergency
situations, preventing emergency situations and determining the
likelihood of them occurring. For example, war, famine, a ruthless
dictator taking over the country, etc

<br>
<br>
.

5. happiness

<br>
<br>


A [non governmental club] with the purpose of studying what creates
happiness, ways to measure happiness and things that can be done to makepeople happier. For example, what effect does affordable housing have onpeople's happiness.

<br>
<br>


6. the revolution

<br>
<br>


A [non governmental club] with the purpose of investigating whether or
not the revolution is happening, and to hold those accountable, if it isnot. Also to ensure that the process is transparent without deception
being involved (If the need to have constant revolutions is later deeme
to be unnecessary, then this one may be removed.)

<br>
<br>


7. local areas

<br>
<br>


Each small area/region has it's own [non governmental club]. The way
this is done is by dividing the land into 900*900m squares, and then 25
of these squares put together, represents a unit that has one [non
governmental club] that represents it. 


Unlike the other permanent [non governmental club]'s, only citizens owning land in these areas, may become a member of these or anybody who can prove that they paid rent for at least 1'800 [Ukku day]s in that zone. Apart from these, all other rules for these remain the same.

<br>
<br>


8. corruption


<br>
<br>


A [non governmental club] with the purpose of investigating
corruption, ensuring that unfair play, does not occur and that those
with political power behave ethically, honestly and with transparency.

<br>
<br>


9. the permanent [non governmental club] for permanent [non
governmental club]s

<br>
<br>


A [non governmental club] with the purpose of watching over all
permanent [non governmental club] s, to ensure that they are sticking
to their intended purpose and for investigating corruption that exists
within these permanent [non governmental club]s.

<br>
<br>


It is a body to watch over the permanent [non governmental club], to
ensure that transparency and fair play occurs.

<br>
<br>


10. the permanent [non governmental club] for non-permanent [non
governmental club]s

<br>
<br>


A [non governmental club] with the purpose of watching over all other
[non governmental club]s, to ensure that they are sticking to their
intended purpose and for investigating corruption that exists within
these [non governmental club]s.

<br>
<br>


It is a body to watch over the non-permanent [non governmental club],
to ensure that transparency and fair play occurs.

<br>
<br>


11. Spending of state in the [Land of Ukku]

<br>
<br>


A [non governmental club] with the purpose of investigating all spendingdone by the state. For example money going in, like taxes or money goingout, like infrastructure projects. They meant to identify any unhelpful
spending/revenue, and suggest improvements.

<br>
<br>


12. improvements

<br>
<br>


A [non governmental club] with the purpose of searching for and investigating areas, that need to be improved. They also meant to give suggestions where appropriate. For example, investigating what the impact is of using toilet paper without any means to wash yourself afterwards, or the impact of drinking and STD's.


<br>
<br>


They also need to investigate new proposals that are brought brought
forward by the public. For example, if a draft is presented to them,
that suggest that membership to certain permanent [non governmental
club]s should be limited to qualified exports only, as opposed to just
anyone: they have the responsibility to investigate that claim.

<br>
<br>


13. implementing improvements

<br>
<br>


A [non governmental club] with the purpose of investigating, testing
and implementing the improvements suggested by the permanent [non
governmental club] mentioned above.

<br>
<br>


14. workplace health and safety

<br>
<br>


A [non governmental club] with the purpose of ensuring that sufficient
health and safety exist for workers in the work place.

<br>
<br>


15. class divide

<br>
<br>


A [non governmental club] with the purpose of ensuring that class
divide is kept as small as possible and tries to remove the existence ofclass wherever possible. 


<br>
<br>


For example, by ensuring that swear words do not exist in language, as bad language creates a division in class, or looking at ways to remove ghettos/isolated communities, within the greater community.

<br>
<br>


16. mockery

<br>
<br>


A [non governmental club] with the purpose of mocking/making fun of
public officials (people with political power) through music, building
insulting statues, posters, movies etc. They also have the job of
fighting against censorship of any criticism of the state. 



<br>
<br>


The purpose of this mockery is, to to prevent the abuse of power and discourage idolisation. It is expected for the public officials being insulted to, take it with grace and good sportsman ship. They are not to strike back at the people doing the mockery.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Permanent [non governmental club coalition]s.</b>

<br>
<br>


If the total number of [non governmental club coalition]s in Ukku is
ever below 9, then there are 3 [non governmental club coalition]s that
exist by default. These [non governmental club coalition]s are the
only [non governmental club coalition]s that do not need to have any
specified purpose and exist regardless of the [non governmental club]s
they have. 


<br>
<br>



Membership is giving to any [non governmental club] who wishes to join (no [non governmental club coalition] can be rejected) and is lost by any [non governmental club coalition] who wishes to leave. All decisions are made by a vote by the members of the [non governmental club]s that form the [non governmental club coalition].



<br>
<br>


Proposals to drafts to be voted on is presented by the [non
governmental club]s themselves. Any [non governmental club coalition]
can make a draft to be voted on.

<br>
<br>


Once there exist 9 or more [non governmental club coalition]s
(excluding these permanent ones) then the permanent [non governmental
club coalition]s dissolve, until the time when the total number of
[non governmental club coalition]s again goes below 9.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Hiring contractors</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Contractors are perhaps one of the greatest risk for corruption to
occur. Governments can use government money on a private company, that
will return the favor. The challenge comes from the reality that
government is often unable to do all tasks it's self and often to do so,is more expensive and ineffective. Not to mentioned that corruption can
occur within the government it's self. 


<br>
<br>


This is especially true for when,
favors need to be returned for jobs that have been unfairly giving.


<br>
<br>


To prevent such corruption, will always be a constant uphill battle. It
will require transparency and investigation from the public. However,
there exists rules that can be put in place.


<br>
<br>


All work that is done by the [Ukku government] and [Ukku Parliament]
need to be done using contractors. The [Ukku government] and [Ukku
Parliament] are not allowed to engage in work directly. The job of the
[Ukku government]s and [Ukku Parliament], is to decide what needs to
be done and how it needs to be done. The actual process of doing it,
needs to be done by third parties.


<br>
<br>


The [Ukku government]s and [Ukku Parliament], is not allowed to
choose the contractors that will do the work. Instead, who is chosen to
do the work is determined by a point based system, consisting upon
fixed/unambiguous rules. These rules are chosen by the [Ukku
government]s or [Ukku Parliament] (depending which one of these are
deciding what needs to be done.) 


<br>
<br>


They have full control to make theserules and to change them at any point. However, they are not allowed to
favor anyone if not chosen by the rules or decline anyone from a
contract work, if the rules set out, favor them.


<br>
<br>


If they decide to update the rules, it is expected for them to give a
reason why. This is to prevent them to making a deal with a specif
contractor and deliberately updating the rules to favor that specific
contractor.

<br>
<br>

<p style="font-size: 27px;">


<b>Balancing of trade

</p>
</b>

<br>
<br>
<br>


<b>   Trade within the nation and international trade</b>

<br>
<br>


Trade needs to be balanced out, inside the [Land of Ukku]. The means
of how this is done, is to be tested. For example, is it based on
population, area etc, that needs to be balanced out and what needs to bedone to balance out such trade.

<br>
<br>


The metaphor to think of, is that of a family household, who earns
money. If you have family living in a house together, they need to
ensure that they do not spend more money than they have. Otherwise, theywill be left with no money. The same concept applies to areas in the
[Land of Ukku].


<br>
<br>


Unlike a family, where one person can make an informed decision, there
exists many people in a society. They spend their money without taking
into account the effect on the wider community. It is like having many
people in a household, spending the money of that household, without
considering how much money is left in the household.

<br>
<br>


If money is drained from a community, by a slightly cheaper alternative
existing externaly of that community, it will mean that money will slowly be drained from that community. The community will get poorer. To
prevent this from happening, there exist rules to balance out money,
that moves in and out of a community. 


<br>
<br>


The more money leaves a community,
the more difficult it will be to buy things from outside that community.The more things are imported to other communities, the easier it will beto buy things from other communities.


<br>
<br>


However, to prevent protectionism from arising, there also needs to be
laws/systems that try to encourage the exporting of goods and services
from that community. The money supply needs to be balanced out. The ideais to make the community suffer as a result of difficulties to import.


<br>
<br>


This suffering will be the pain that will drive the community to be
innovative. Pain is what forces the community to innervate and start
exporting more to cover what they are buying. The greater the pain, the
greater the incentive to innervate. Any laws/systems put in place that
do not aid the community to balance out such a trade imbalance, should
be called out for what it is: protectionism.


<br>
<br>


This ideal for balancing out trade, is also to exist for international
trade. If the [Land of Ukku] imports without replacing the money lost,
it means that it will run out of money. 


<br>
<br>


However, if the [Land of Ukku] takes money from other countries without allowing them to recover, it means that it will weaken their economy (the economies of it's trading partners), by pulling money out without it being replaced. In order to prevent harm to the [Land of Ukku] or it's allies (that it depends on their well-being to be maintained to keep trade going) it needs to ensure that there are rules put in place to ensure that trade between the countries are balanced. 


<br>
<br>


Trade is important as it creates a comparative advantage, increases competition (both for goods/services as well as for employers/employees) and creates an environment where two countries can challenge each others cultures, norms and beliefs. 

<br>
<br>


For this reason it is important for the [Land of Ukku] to create trade
systems/rules that are formed by the three principals below


<br>
<br>


1) be consistent


<br>
<br>


They cannot be changed at the desire of a politician.


<br>
<br>


2) ban protectionist policies


<br>
<br>


They need to make rules that stop countries from engaging in
protectionism. For essentials, such as food protection, countries are
expected to ensure that food is grown from within their own borders (to
prepare for times of crisis and political weaponisation) without adding
tariffs to international trade or without implementing measures that
will restrict intentional trade.

<br>
<br>


3) encourage innervation

<br>
<br>


They need to promote innovation in times of low imports, as to allow the
<br>
<br>


country to export more and import less. The less the imports, the more
the [Land of Ukku] needs to be forced to innervate its economy, as to
adjust for the trade imbalance.

<br>
<br>

	
<b>   Joining of international organisations</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


In order for the [Land of Ukku] to engage in the world around it,
spread it's ideals and be challenged by the ideals of other countries,
it needs to be open to joining in it's markets and political discussions.

<br>
<br>


Therefore, it is in the best interest of the [Land of Ukku], to be
part of major trade groups and political groups. These include things
like the UN, WTO, etc.

<br>
<br>


However, the reality is that the ability to join these, depends on the
willingness of such organisations to accept the [Land of Ukku] as a
member.


<br>
<br>


 Also, there exists the possibility that the [Land of Ukku] may
not be able to join, based upon the group objecting to allow for the
fundamental principals outlined in this document (or another fundamenta
principals that the [Land of Ukku] needs to be 100% transparent, with noexceptions. 

<br>
<br>


Working with an organisation that doesn't do deals under
transparency, may be frowned upon. Another issue is debt. The [Land of
Ukku] cannot legally get into debt. If there are amounts that need to
be payed and it can't pay them back, then it needs to leave the
organisation and default on it's debts. For this reason, it will be wis
to pay any member fees in advance.


<br>
<br>


If any such contradictions exist, then it is up to the state to
negotiate a better deal. For example, an exception may be made to allow
for the [Land of Ukku] to keep it's approach to intellectual property,
without needing to create restrictions on who can access and use foreignintellectual property. 

<br>
<br>


During such negotiations, it is important that the [Land of Ukku] keeps in mind that not all policies of anyorganisation are bad. For example, the WTO free trade approach, helps toprevent politicians from using protectionist policies and also prevents
trade wars. 


<br>
<br>


Trade wars are costly, negatively effect the economy and divert attention from more important issues.


<br>
<br>


If such negotiations fail or if the organisations fail to accept the
[Land of Ukku], it becomes the responsibility for the [Land of Ukku]
to adapt to the situation by creating it's own alternative organisations, if need be. During such a process, the goal is not to criticise the organisation that the [Land of Ukku] is trying to clone.


<br>
<br>

Any confrontational language must be avoided. Instead it needs to be
made clear why such a clone of the organisation needs to be created. Forexample, if an organisation does not allow the [Land of Ukku] to
operate in a completely transparent manner, then that would be the
reason provided. 

<br>
<br>


The [Land of Ukku] needs to make clear that, if it were not for the problems outlined, then it would join the organisation. 


<br>
<br>


By stating this objective, you ensure that the organisation is open to
further talks, which may provide an option to join that is not in
conflict with the values of the [Land of Ukku].

<br>
<br>

<b>Doing business in the [Land of Ukku]

</p>
</b>

    
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>   Legal entities</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


The [Land of Ukku] does not have any separate laws for legal entities.
Legal entities have no legal standing and therefore do not exist,
legally speaking. The only exception to this are [non governmental
club]s and [non governmental club coalition]s, which are considered
legal entities. Legally speaking, the [Ukku government]s or [Ukku
parliament] are not legal entities.


<br>
<br>


<b>   Companies</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


As soon as somebody sells a product/service to someone else, they are
considered to be a company, legally speaking. However, such a company does not have a registered trade name to uniquely identify it and therefo
exists in terms of it's owner. It is uniquely identified in terms of
it's owner.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Responsibility</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Since legal entities do not exist, individuals are accountable to their
own action and cannot legally hide behind a company. Any company has an
owner and they will be held accountable for decisions they make in their own company.


<br>
<br>


Depending on the circumstances and laws involved, an employee/employees
of a company may be held responsible for their own actions, the owner o
the company may take responsibility for the employees actions or they
may both be held responsible for the actions of the employee/employees.

<br>
<br>


Despite the fact that both [non governmental club]s and [non
governmental club coalition]s are legal entities, they still face some
form of accountability. For example, if decisions are made by a vote of
members and they vote to break the law, all the members who voted to
break the law will be prosecuted. However, the legal entity is
responsible for it's self. 

<br>
<br>


For example, a [non governmental club coalition] can sign contracts on it's behalf and none of the members
are responsible for that contract. Only the legal entity itself, can be
held responsible. This is different to companies that have no such
protection and legally speaking, all contracts will need to be made by
people within the company. Companies have no representation, legally
speaking.

<br>
<br>


A grey area exists, in determining the laws regarding responsibilities
for [non governmental club]s and [non governmental club coalition]s.
It would be up to the society to resolve such contradictions. If abuse
occurs, as a result of this legal status (e.g. if [non governmental
club]s are being used for fraud to allow themselves to legally break
contracts) then the right for [non governmental club]s and [non
governmental club coalition]s to exists as a legal entity, may be
removed entirely.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Funding and trade marks</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


There exists however legally binding contracts between the state and
individuals to represent certain groups.¥ This is the only way to
formally register a company.

<br>
<br>


If you wish to sell a company (pass down/sell ownership) you will need
to do this. You will also need to do this to be able to legally sell
under a specific trade name. Trade marks present a complication as
legally speaking you cannot own a trade mark (you can only own the tradename.) 

<br>
<br>


However, a company is not allowed to try to pretend to be another
company. So if you try to copy another company's logo, that will be
illegal, unless it is clearly obvious to any reasonable person, that
your company is a different company. For example, if the names are
greatly different and one company sells shoes, while the other company,
using the same logo, provides legal advice: then the same trade mark maybe used.

<br>
<br>


<b>   The 5 kinds of companies that exist</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


There are three kinds of companies

<br>
<br>


1) an unregistered company

<br>
<br>


As soon as any person sells something, legally speaking, they sell unde
this company.

<br>
<br>


2) a company registered by normal means

<br>
<br>


When you create a legally binding contract, between the state and
individual, to represent a company, you operate under this type of
company.

<br>
<br>


All assists owned by the company belong to the company and not to the
owner. What the owner owns and what the company owns is different. This
distinction is made for purposes of buying/selling companies. 

<br>
<br>


For example, if a person breaks something and cannot pay back the money
assists from their company may be sold to cover the costs involved. The
company is simple viewed in terms of it's owner.

<br>
<br>


3) a registered democratic company voting for a group

<br>
<br>


These companies have a vote (transferable vote system, with negative
voting included) that exist between all employees. How often they vote
is decided by the employees but must not be less than 10 [Ukku day]s
and not more than 1'800 [Ukku day]s).

<br>
<br>


All the employees can vote for a group of people to finally vote for a
leader of the company. The group is not allowed to be less than 5 peopleand not more than 900 people. The size of this group is again decided bythe rules put in place by employees of the company. 

<br>
<br>


It can only be changed by the employees of the company. The leader that this group chooses to run the company can be anyone. It can be someone already employed by the company or can get someone external of the company.


<br>
<br>


4) a registered democratic company voting for a leader


<br>
<br>


These companies have a vote (transferable vote system, with negative
voting included) that exist between all employees. How often they vote
is decided by the employees but must not be less than 10 [Ukku day]s
and not more than 1'800 [Ukku day]s).


<br>
<br>


All the employees can vote for someone to become the leader of the
company for the duration of that term. The leader that this group
chooses to run the company can be anyone. It can be someone already
employed by the company or can get someone external of the company.

<br>
<br>


5) A registered democratic group voting company

<br>
<br>


These companies have a vote (transferable vote system, with negative
voting included) that exist between all employees. How often they vote
is decided by the employees but must not be less than 10 [Ukku day]s
and not more than 1'800 [Ukku day]s).


<br>
<br>


All the employees can vote for a group of people to finally run the
company. The group is not allowed to be less than 5 people and not more
than 900 people. The size of this group is again decided by the rules
put in place by employees of the company. It can only be changed by the
employees of the company.

<br>
<br>


Unlike with the 3rd type of company, the group it's self votes on
decisions directly. They do not elect a leader.

<br>
<br>


6) A registered directly democratic company

<br>
<br>


These companies make their decisions based upon the outcome of a vote
(transferable vote system, with negative voting included) by all the
members involved. They are allowed to have certain rules put in place,
to make the company run more quickly and effectively, but these rules
need to be determined by the votes of the employees of the company.

<br>
<br>


A company may change to any of the 6 at any point. It is not legally
obliged to stay as the type of company that it was formed under.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Partnerships</b>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


Legally, the 2nd type of company registered, must have only 1 owner.
However many companies may join together to operate under a single trad
name.

<br>
<br>


All assists owned by the company, belong to the company and not the
owner. What the owner owns and what the company owns are different.
Assists also do not belong to any of the other companies who form
together to form one of these.


<br>
<br>


This arrangement is a contract between different companies and
responsibility for individual decisions depends on what the individual
companies decide to do. Accountability depends on what a company has
chosen to do. The responsibilities of the companies in the partnership
may not overlap.


<br>
<br>


Due to the fact that this is a contract, all contracts rules apply and
therefore so to do the expiry dates. The members will need to renew the
contract again and that means that some members can be excluded in
future and legally there are no consequences for doing so.


<br>
<br>


It is important to note that the 2nd type of company exists as a
contract between the individual and the state. However, the basic fact
of operating renews the contract and therefore no need to renew
contracts for companies on their own. However, if a business stops
operating after enough time, it expires based upon the normal time
limits set for companies and therefore loses it's trade name.


<br>
<br>


<b>   Accountability for democratic companies</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Democratic companies share ownership between all employees. Therefore,
decisions made are done by vote. They are not a legal entity, legally
speaking, as the company cannot make contracts on it's own (only via
people on behalf of the company, hence employees). 


<br>
<br>


However, there is no true owner. The owners are the employees. Therefore accountability is difficult for such companies and grey areas exist. Their existence is tobe tried and tested and it is up to the society to determine what laws involving accountability, need to be put in place.


<br>
<br>


<b>   Selling a company</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


A company may be sold/giving away to someone else but then they will
become the legal owner of the company.


<br>
<br>


<b>   Funding with share equivalents</b>

<br>
<br>


As stated above, parts of ownership cannot be sold and therefore shares
of a company cannot be sold. Their is an equivalent to shares that can
be bought and sold. The company can sell these freely. However, they
will then be selling a percentage of their growth profit (before it is
allowed to re-enter back into the business).

<br>
<br>


There are two types of these share equivalents

<br>
<br>


1) voting

<br>
<br>


2) non-voting

<br>
<br>


Non-voting share equivalents are profit only, while voting share
equivalents allow for the share equivalent owner (based on the
percentage they own) to vote on company decisions. 


<br>
<br>


An exception exist for their voting and that is for the decision to sell more of these 'share equivalents' and for their to be a change of owners in the business. Such decisions is to be decided by the owner/owners.

<br>
<br>


When the owner/owners sell voting share equivalents, they give up the
right to make decisions in their own business. In order to make
decisions in the company, they will need to own some voting share
equivalents themselves in order to make decisions.


<br>
<br>


The difference between these shares and a normal shares, is that they
are not permanent and expire after a certain point. They expiry is basedon time. A business owner has the following options, as to what type of
expiry they place on these share equivalents.

<br>
<br>


1) expires 15 [Ukku day]s after [Ukku share] has been bought (can be
sold any number of times)

<br>
<br>


2) expires 30 [Ukku day]s after [Ukku share] has been bought (can be
sold any number of times)

<br>
<br>


3) expires 450 [Ukku day]s after [Ukku share] has been bought (can be
sold any number of times)

<br>
<br>


4) expires 900 [Ukku days] after [Ukku share] has been bought (can only
be sold once every [Ukku day]. That means that if someone buys the the
share equivalent, they need to wait at least 1 [Ukku day] before they
can resell it)


<br>
<br>


5) expires 13'500 [Ukku day]s after [Ukku share] has been bought (can
only be sold once every 900 [Ukku day]s. That means that if someone
buys the the share equivalent, they need to wait at least 900 [Ukku
day]s before they can resell it)
expires 27'000 [Ukku day]s after [Ukku share] has been bought (can
only be sold once every 13'500 [Ukku day]s. 


<br>
<br>



That means that if someone buys the the share equivalent, they need to wait at least 900 [Ukku day]s before they can resell it)


<br>
<br>


These share equivalents can be resold at a later stage, but the expiry
date still exists. The expire date ensures that value is generated in
the economy. It prevents old wealth existing via destructive passive
income from share value. In order to receive money you need to
contribute to the economy, not take away from that economy.


<br>
<br>


<b>   Funding with loan equivalents</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>

As with shares, loans cannot be made and sold. This is because debt is
illegal (with the exception of buying foreign debt/lending out money to
others outside of the country.) However there exists an equivalent to a
loan, where 50% of all gross profit (before 'share' holders') goes
back to repaying this.


<br>
<br>


There are no legal punishments for the loan not being returned, but the
percentage will stay until the desired amount is reached. There are
three types of 'loans'


<br>
<br>


1) one that stays there until 3 times the initial investment is returned
<br>
<br>


2) one that stays there till 5 times the initial investment returns

<br>
<br>


3) one that stays there until 15 times the initial investment is returned.

<br>
<br>


The decision to get such a 'loan' is decided by the share holders, not
the owner, if a business has shares.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Death</b>


<br>
<br>


When a registered company has no employees and the owner dies, without
confirming who receives their assists when they die, then all the
business assets are treated as their personal assists. Therefore they
are handed to the state to be used as a sink hole (the money is
destroyed). 

<br>
<br>


Why this is done is explained later in this document when explaining how money is created. Unregistered companies are treated the
same way.

<br>
<br>


When a registered company has employees and the owner dies without
confirming who receives their assists when they die, then all the
business belongs to the employees. If only one employee exists, then
they become the owner. If more than one employee exists, then the
company becomes directly democratic.
<br>
<br>


 All the employees can vote
together. In reality they will most likely vote to make it another form
of company and therefore this is expected to only be a temporary stateof existence.


<br>
<br>


<b>   Limitations of passing down companies</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>

Every time the owner changes in a 2nd type of company, a point is
giving to that company. A company is only allowed to earn 11 points.
After that, it needs to be registered as any of the 4 other democratic
companies. It is never allowed to be the 2nd type of company again.
All of it's assists stay with it.


<br>
<br>


Should a 2nd type of company change to being another type of company,
the points still keep with it. For example, a completely democratic
company with 3 points, still keeps it's 3 points when transferring back
into the 2nd type of company.

<br>
<br>


The intention of this is to prevent unproductive wealth/destructive
passive income and instead encourage positive contributions to society.
However, this idea is restrictive in nature and is yet to be tested in
the real world. It may prove that this limitation proves to do more harmthan good. It may be removed at a later stage of the existence of the
[Land of Ukku]. 


<br>
<br>


If such a change is to be done, there needs to be public debate before hand and it needs to be determined what influence big monopolistic companies may have in, trying to persuade the society to do such a change.

<br>
<br>


Fraud is always a problem and one risk of creating this limit, is that
owners may hide their own deaths (especially for companies that have 11
points). 

<br>
<br>



When an owner disappears from the public and if an owner cannotprove they are alive, this is seen as fraud as the person is assumed to be dead. If this is later proved to be false, the decision is reversed.

<br>
<br>


When death is suspected to exist, the 'person' is assumed to be dead
until proven to be alive.


<br>
<br>


<b>   Large companies</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>

What the distinction is between a large company and a normal company,
legally speaking, needs to be decided by the society itself. 

<br>
<br>



However, regardless of which type of company they are, there needs to be a procedure to determine when they are a large company, legally speaking.

<br>
<br>



This applies to even unregistered companies, as strange as that sounds
(the first type of company.)

<br>
<br>


When companies become big the following apply.

<br>
<br>


All salaries, by law, need to be publicly accessible on the [national
site], along with who is earning those salaries in the company. There
also needs to be complete transparency on all their spending habits. 


<br>
<br>


For example, how much they pay to get the raw ingredients, the processes, profits, etc etc. All that information need to also be accessible on the [national site].

<br>
<br>


On the [national site] one needs to look up a large company and see a
full list of the value chain. For example, bought steal at what price,
paid labor what price to turn steal into cylinders, sold cylinders at
what price. This is also useful in helping to prevent fraud.


<br>
<br>


<b>   NGO's, trusts, etc</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Legally binding contracts between you and the state to represent certaingroups, only exist for creating companies. Legally speaking, NGO's,
inheritance trusts, etc, do not exist. Therefore, no non profit is
excluding from tax. If they own land, then they pay the tax for it.


<br>
<br>


If any NGO or any organisation, wishes to have a unique trade name, theywill need to be registered as a company.
<br>
<br>

<b> Legal

</p>
</b>

<br>
<br>
<br>



Three laws for the [Ukku government] and [Ukku parliament]

<br>
<br>


In order to protect citizens from the bad decisions made by the [Ukku
government] and [Ukku parliament], there exist 4 restricting to their
power. For them to change these restrictions would be illegal.


<br>
<br>


1) borrowing money


<br>
<br>


legally they may not borrow money. No debt is allowed to be created. If
however debt is created, the government has legal responsibility to
write it off, as paying it back would also be considered a crime.


<br>
<br>


They can however lend out money to others (outside of the [Land of
Ukku], with ether the intentions of them paying it back or to use it as
leverage over them.

<br>
<br>


This is true for anyone in the state as well. No one is allowed to
borrow money. Debt is seen as creating inflation (for example, spiking
up property prices as it acts as a means to print money), creating
financial instability and creating financial bubbles. 

<br>
<br>


To borrow money isa crime but to pay back that money would be to commit another crime. If one borrows money (which is illegal) they are legally required not to pay it back


<br>
<br>


2) declaring war

<br>
<br>


they cannot legally declare war. This incorporates any means of war as
well. For example, they cannot own a military. Any members employed by
the government must be employed purely for defensive purposes


<br>
<br>


3) all equal before the law

 <br>
<br>


this means that no one is allowed to gain any preferences. Therefore
concepts such as diplomatic community, do not exist in the [Land of
Ukku]. If a country chooses to send someone to live in the [Land of
Ukku] and chooses to give them the title of a diplomat: legally, they
are no different to any other person who chooses to stay in the [Land
of Ukku].


<br>
<br>


4) right to assemble in a peaceful manner


<br>
<br>


citizens may show there discontent for any reason what so ever and may
assemble freely together.



<br>
<br>


However, this right is heavily restricted to being done in a peaceful
manner. They do not have the right to create noise pollution (especial
where people may be sleeping), block walk ways, disrupts roads, restric
the profits of businesses, etc, or do any other harmful behavior, such
as deliberately overloading trains during peak hour traffic.


<br>
<br>


There is a procedure to create their own break-away society, if truly
unsatisfied, but they cannot harm others in the process. This process i
discussed later, towards the end of the document.


<br>
<br>


<b>   How laws are divided</b>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


Laws are dived/labeled by who they apply to. For example, you get laws
that apply for everyone, laws that apply to the [Ukku governments],
laws that apply to large businesses. This allows for laws to be more
easily searched for and allows for one to easily look up all the laws
that apply to themselves or someone/something else.


<br>
<br>


<b>   How new laws are made and old laws changed/removed</b>


<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


Neither the [Ukku government] or [Ukku parliament] have the power to
make/remove laws and to make changes to those laws. This power is givingto the [non governmental club coalition]s to start the process and for
the [Ukku parliament] to finally vote on such a law at the end.


<br>
<br>


Below is the process to be followed, when creating new laws

<br>
<br>


1) firstly a greater domain problem, where smaller, more specific, problems occur, must be determined. For example, if there isn't enough housing asa greater domain problem.

<br>
<br>


1. A [non governmental club coalition] creates a draft to define this
greater domain problem


<br>
<br>


2. [Ukku parliament] reviews the draft and makes changes, if need be


<br>
<br>


3. The [non governmental club coalition] that wrote the initial
draft, reviews the changes. If they are happy with it, it goes to the
next step: if not, then it goes back to step a)


<br>
<br>


2) then an ideology must be determined to look at this problem. For
example, is housing more important than nature? Do we mind building intoforests? Is bureaucracy a problem? Do we wish to avoid bureaucratic red
tape as much as possible? Is it a case of the simpler the laws the
better?


<br>
<br>


1. a draft stating and explaining the ideology that is chosen, is to be
written by the [non governmental club coalition]


<br>
<br>


2. [Ukku parliament] reviews the draft and makes changes, if need be


<br>
<br>


3. the initial [non governmental club coalition] reviews the draft
and if they are happy, it goes to the next step: if not, then it goes
back to step a)


<br>
<br>


3) then a smaller, more specific, problem must be determined from this
greater domain problem (e.g. people buying houses and not living in
them)

<br>
<br>


1. a draft to define this problem is written by the [non governmental
club coalition]

<br>
<br>


2. [Ukku parliament] reviews the draft and makes changes if need be


<br>
<br>


3. the initial [non governmental club coalition] reviews the draft
and if they are happy, it goes to the next step: if not, then it goes
back to step a)


<br>
<br>


4) then a solution must be determined to resolve this (e.g. do laws need to be changed, do we need more educators etc). The [non governmental club coalition] also looks at the time frame. Sometimes a law needs to be
changed for a specific period of time (e.g. the Covid lock-down) and
therefore needs to be made to have an exit date or an exit determined b
another factor.

<br>
<br>


1. a draft to define a solution and justify why it is needed, is
written by the [non governmental club coalition]


<br>
<br>


2. [Ukku parliament] reviews the draft and makes changes, if need be


<br>
<br>



3. the initial [non governmental club coalition] reviews the draft
and if they are happy, it goes to the next step: if not, then it goes
back to step a)


<br>
<br>


If laws are what needed then laws are changed

<br>
<br>


1) a draft of the new laws are written by the [non governmental club
coalition]


<br>
<br>


2) [Ukku parliament] reviews the draft and makes changes if need be


<br>
<br>


3) the initial [non governmental club coalition] reviews the draft
and if they are happy, it goes to the next step: if not, then it goes
back to step a)


<br>
<br>


<b>   the law creating department</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


d) the law creating department of the [Ukku Parliament] (mentioned
earlier in the document, they are the ones who are knowledgeable in law
makes the draft into a law, with the correct legal language. 


<br>
<br>


It is not their job to change anything or to decide how they feel about the law. Their only job is to make it legally ready (This includes seeing if the law would clash with any previous laws). They need to add clear notes explaining exactly what changes they did and why they did it.


<br>
<br>


e) the bill is then reviewed by [Ukku parliament]. If it is approved,
it goes to the next step: if not, then it is readjusted. Then after
readjustment, it is send back to step d) again.


<br>
<br>


f) the bill is reviewed by the initial [non governmental club
coalition] and then they have the decision to finally approve the law
or to send it back to steps d) or e), with their modifications.


<br>
<br>


After the bill has been finalised, time is kept to allow for debates
and public scrutiny to occur. After such time is kept, it is voted on
in the [Ukku parliament]. This vote will determine if the law, or
changes to a law, go through or not.
<br>
<br>


Sometimes, steps 1 and 2 have been done before for a problem. Therefore,they don't need to be done again. Instead the club can list the greater
domain problem and the ideology mentioned before.


<br>
<br>


However, steps 3, 4 and 5 cannot be skipped.


<br>
<br>


<b>   How the [Ukku parliament] makes changes to the draft if need be. </b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


As mentioned earlier in this document, the [Ukku parliament] only has
the ability to vote yes/no for decisions. Due to this, it is impossible
for the [Ukku parliament to make changes directly. 

<br>
<br>



Therefore when a draft is voted against anyone who voted against the draft (and only those who voted against it), have the opportunity to send
recommendations of what needs to be improved (the reason for why they
voted against the initial draft).

<br>
<br>


Then the 3 [Ukku government]s work together to decide what changes
need to be made based upon these recommendations. Then some time needs
to pass as to allow the public time to debate this finalised draft, as
to decide if it correctly represents the recommendations put forward an
if the recommendations that were left out need to be put back in.


<br>
<br>


After that the 3 [Ukku government]s work together to consider the
input from the public and make edits to the changes put forward if
needed.

<br>
<br>


If at any point any of the [Ukku government]s are in disagreement
about the draft, then they create a separate draft.

<br>
<br>


If there are more than one draft, then the 3 [Ukku government]s vote
on which draft to put forward to the [Ukku parliament].


<br>
<br>


If the [Ukku parliament] rejects this new bill then it needs to go
back to the 3 [Ukku government]s to vote on.

<br>
<br>


In the event where the 3 [Ukku government]s are abusing their power,
then there exists a way to choose another organisation to approve the
drafts on their behalf. If more than half of the [non governmental club
coalition]s sign a petition, then there is a [non governmental club
coalition] vote that is optional for any [non governmental club
coalition]s. 

<br>
<br>



This acts as a general election where different organisations can run. There needs to be sufficient time to allow for open debate to take place. Once a candidate has been chosen then a vote is done by the [Ukku parliament] as whether or not to replace the 3 [Ukku government]s with this candidate.


<br>
<br>


If rejected, there is no time limit before the [non governmental club
coalition]s can sign another petition and get the process started
again.


<br>
<br>


<b>   Emergency laws</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


The process above, for making laws, is cumbersome. There exists an
emergency procedure for making laws, that [Ukku parliament] can use at
any time. These 'emergency laws' can only exist for 60 [Ukku day]s,
and in the draft of these laws, there needs to be detailed instructions
of how the laws will transition out of place by 50 [Ukku day]s. This
is to prevent the chaos created as the law returns back to normal.


<br>
<br>


During the first 30 [Ukku day]s, there should be debates taking place.
30 [Ukku day]s into the law, there is a [non governmental club
coalition] vote that is optional for any [non governmental club
coalition]. They vote simply yes/no as to whether or not the time frame
for the existence of this new emergency law should be extended.


<br>
<br>


If voted not to be extended, then after 50 [Ukku day]s the law will
follow it's planned exit and after 60 [Ukku day]s it will be gone.


<br>
<br>


If voted to be extended, then the 3 [Ukku government]s have 30 more
[Ukku day]s to come together with a draft giving a new deadline for
the law and explaining their reasoning.


<br>
<br>


The draft is then voting by the [non governmental club coalition]s in
an open optional vote and they decide to vote for it or against it.


<br>
<br>


If they vote against it, another vote is held to vote if the 3 [Ukku
government]s should be giving another 30 [Ukku day]s to make another
draft or if they should cancel the law. If they choose to cancel the lawthen 20 more [Ukku day]s of the law is giving with the last 10 [Ukku
day]s again being used for the transition back to normal.


<br>
<br>


If they agree to the deadline, the the law exist for the duration of thetime frame provided. In order for this law to be made permanent, it
needs to be recreated by using the normal procedure for making laws.


<br>
<br>



Keep in mind that the normal procedure can accommodate for laws of a
temporary nature as well. If time runs out, then the law phases out
based upon the means agreed for such to happen, in the draft of the law.

<br>
<br>


If an emergency law is rejected/expires, then [Ukku parliament] is not
allowed to make that same emergency law again, or a law similar to it,
for 900 [Ukku day]s. Whether it is similar or not, is determined by
the law creating department of the [Ukku Parliament] (mentioned
earlier in the document) [Ukku parliament] is only allowed to make 3 of these laws every 900 [Ukku day]s. 


<br>
<br>


However, these are expected to be used in purely emergency situations. To make use of emergency laws in normal circumstances would be considered an abuse of power.


<br>
<br>


<b>   How Emergency laws are created before the [Ukku parliament] vote</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Emergency laws are to voted on by the [Ukku parliament] as soon as
they are drafted. They take preference to any other law being voted onby the [Ukku parliament].


<br>
<br>


Any of the 3 [Ukku government]s can create one emergency law draft
once every 900 [Ukku day]s. They don't need the approval from any of
the other [Ukku government]s to send this draft to be voted on by the
[Ukku parliament]. 


<br>
<br>


However, it is expected of them that they contact the other [Ukku government]s as to draft the law together. It is also expected of them to only make such a draft in times of emergency.


<br>
<br>


The three [Ukku government]s have the ability to have one extra draft
if they all vote together for a draft. This means that if this one is
rejected, each [Ukku government] will have the opportunity to create adraft under themselves (if they haven't done so within 900 [Ukku
day]s). 

<br>
<br>


As with the submission time of 900 [Ukku day]s for each [Ukku government] individually, if the 3 [Ukku government]s submit a draft together, they will need to wait 900 [Ukku day]s before being able to submit another draft.


<br>
<br>


An emergency law needs the approval of the [Ukku parliament] to be pu
through. If the [Ukku parliament vote against the bill, then that bil
is rejected. 

<br>
<br>



It can only be voted on again if one of the other [Ukku government]s daft it again, 900 [Ukku day]s pass or if the three [Ukku government]s vote on it together.

<br>
<br>


<b>   What happens after laws have been approved</b>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>



The state has the following responsibilities, after a law has been
drafted and approved

<br>
<br>


1) ensure peoples behavior is in line with the law (i.e. people do notbreak the law. For example, ensuring that people don't steal)


<br>
<br>


2) to correct deviant behavior


<br>
<br>

Other factors, such as the impact on the victims/if the victims seeks
revenge, are not taken into account. The only consideration is what
impact policies have in terms of ensuring that points 1 and 2 are met.
<br>
<br>


<b>   Punishments</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Punishment is not the default approach taken to deal with people
breaking the laws. It is only one of the tools that can be used to
achieve the goals above. Other tools may include manipulation, using
guilt/shame, using incentives, making it not physically possible to
break a law, etc.

<br>
<br>


Punishments do ensure that both 1 and 2 are met. They prevent people
from breaking a law, due to the fear of being punished and they correct faulty behavior, once it occurs, due to them not wishing to be punished again. The best punishments to ensure that point 1 is met, are
punishments that become a spectacle to the public. 

<br>
<br>


You need to make an example of the victim being punished. The best punishments for point 2, are punishments that are remembered and relatable to the crime committed, in one way or another. Also, the easier the path for rehabilitation is (for after the punishment has been served) the greate the second point will be, in preventing the victim from recommitting. Harsher/worse punishments do not perform better for point 2. 

<br>
<br>


The thing that makes them work, is how they are remembered. As for point 1, the worse the punishment looks, the more likely people will be to obey the law. Therefore, punishments such as sleep deprivation or isolating people in cages, have less of an impact. This is due to the lack of the ability to see the pain involved. While a public flogging, despite inflicting less pain on the victims involved, will be a more effective punishments in preventing people from doing crimes. Violent punishments should be avoided however. 


<br>
<br>


Their usage creates an environment where violence will be likely to occur in the society. Violence disrupts power structures and therefore is to be avoided, as it replaces order with chaos.


<br>
<br>


<b>   Preventing/correcting behavior</b> 


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Punishment is one tool that can be used to achieve 1 and 2 but may notalways be the most appropriate. To discover the most appropriate tool,the following 4 are used.


<br>
<br>


1) statistics/data (both current data of illegal behavior committed and results of previous attempts to achieve points 1 and 2)

<br>
<br>


2) a [basic desire sheet] assessment to try to determine, what
sufferings/holes was present in the person doing the wrong behavior,
that they were trying to fill

<br>
<br>


3) a good understanding of how human psychology works and what makes people
do the things they do

<br>
<br>


4) research into the ideology (beliefs believed to be true) of the people breaking the laws and how this ideology has effected people's behavior in previous statistics/data. For example, are people refusing to take compulsory vaccines because they are part of the anti-vaccine movement OR are vegetarians burning down slaughter houses, because they are opposed to the killing of animals


<br>
<br>


<b>   Jails/prisons</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


As mentioned before, punishment is not the default approach taken to
prevent crime and correct deviant behavior, but should it be decided to be used, there exists many possible ways in which the victim may be
punished. One of these ways is via a prison/jail system.


<br>
<br>


Should jails/prisons exist in the [land of Ukku], it needs to be
ensured that the inmates are treated in a fair and humane manner.

<br>
<br>


They need to have the following rights


<br>
<br>


1) the right to work and start businesses (however, the state has the right to heavily tax these profits via a permit system. The state may not take more that 75% of their total earnings [earnings not profits])

<br>
<br>


2) they must have the right to participate in politics to the same extent as anyone else (e.g. if voting exists, they must be able to vote as well)


<br>
<br>


3) must be able to receive education to the same extent as any other
citizen that is not being punished


<br>
<br>


4) must have the right to medical treatment (both in terms of maintaining good health and treating bad health)

<br>
<br>


5) must be allowed to participate in society and have access to the
internet (to social media at least, if otherwise the internet is
restricted). 


<br>
<br>


Therefore, allowing them to communicate and participate with the world around them and to expose any abuse or neglect.


<br>
<br>


Therefore, it is essential that prisoners have an electronic device.
{for security reasons, it may be that this internet use may need to b
monitored to some extent. For example, a predator may use their right tosocial media to target children.}


<br>
<br>


Any citizen also has the right to investigate prisons, to see if they
are following these guidelines.


<br>
<br>


<b>   Policing</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


There are two types of police

<br>
<br>


1 ) that enforces the law


<br>
<br>


2) one that is not legally allowed to report any crime or anti-social
behavior they witness. Instead it is expected that they act more like a social worker. The only exception to this, is an attempted to bribe suchofficers themselves.


<br>
<br>


This is put in place as to prevent people trying to do so without facing legal consequences and therefore to keep this police force pure


<br>
<br>


These two police officers must wear completely different uniforms and do not work together. The one can be thought of more as social workerstrying to observe and collect data from those committing crimes and
trying to encourage people to follow the laws: while the other can
instead be thought of as the one that dishes out the punishment.


<br>
<br>


<b>   The courts</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Courts only exist for one purpose only, and that is to determine what
laws have been broken. Courts are not responsible to resolving deputes, there is another body for that. The way that the court determines if a crime has been done, is by a legal investigation. 


<br>
<br>


Legal investigations are not divided by accuser and accused, but instead by only one single party investigating what happened. All investigations are transparent and anybody from the public is allowed into the court room.


<br>
<br>


<b>   Resolving disputes</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>




There exists a body with the responsibility of resolving disputes. Forexample, between married couples over ownership of property, if your
neighbor is too loud etc. Despite being an effective means to resolve
deputes, they have no legal power and cannot enforce anything.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Avoiding trial</b>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


One cannot be assumed guilty for avoiding trial. However, there is a
separate legal punishment for doing so. The police have the right to use force to capture the one's being investigated and forcefully bring them to court. This is similar to the way in which people are forcefully brought to prison.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Witnesses</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


A witness is anyone who has witnessed the crime, even the accused. Allwitnesses that are interviewed, are interviewed in private as to prevent biases. However, an audio recording is made and accessible to all the public, after the trial has happened.

<br>
<br>


The only exception to this is if someone is a student and/or teacher of something legally applicable, they may be allowed in, to see the trial, when giving permission by the parties involved.


<br>
<br>


<b>   Legal analysts</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


In the court room there are no judges but instead legal analysts. It is the job of the legal analysts to help discover if the law has been
broken or not. The law is clear and the purpose of the legal analysts is not to interpret the law but instead allow a team of investigators to find out what happened. 

<br>
<br>


Afterwards, they compare what actually happened to what is legal and illegal. Their job is exact, like a machine. They are never allowed to make any decisions. They are not allowed to decide anything. They can only follow the rules of the systems.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Situational analysts</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Situational analysts take the evidence presented to them and use this to
give a verdict as to what happened.

<br>
<br>


When a witness is interviewed, the situational analysts do not see theinterview or the transcript. They work with third bodies and detectives, after the interview. These third bodies may analyse the interview
recording and create a transcript. Detectives gather evidence and may
have access to both the recording of the interview and the transcripts.

<br>
<br>


This is to prevent bias (especially in terms of cultural stigmas, likerace) and personal feelings. For example, if someone is cocky and has a bad attitude in an investigation, that is not a crime and they should not be legally punished due to their attitude.

<br>
<br>



To further prevent biased, their exists 5 different situational analysts and they work independently from each other. Then the medium of the 5 assumptions about what happened, will finally be sent off to the legal analyst to look into.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Grey areas</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


There is yet another department that look for 'grey areas' inside the
law. These 'grey areas' are things which might be legal or illegal based in the law, but this is based on a technicality, as opposed to what the law intended for. They meant to look for such loop holes and prevent them from occurring. 


<br>
<br>


When they occur, the person still is treated based upon the law as it is. However, it is their job to fix the law as quickly as possible (by going through the normal process for changing laws via [non governmental club coalition]s).


<br>
<br>


<b>   Lawyers</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


lawyers are banned. It is both illegal to become a lawyer and to hire a lawyer. This is because it is illegal to try to influence the outcome of a legal investigation. However, not all legal work traditionally done by a lawyer is intended to sway the result of a trial. 


<br>
<br>


Therefore, their exists legal assistants for companies and individuals. They are responsibility for explaining what the law is and to give legal advice, to ensure that people/companies do not break the law. They ensure that their clients are aware, when others they work with, break the law, so that they can report it. The legal advice can also be to advice on decisions based on existing laws. 


<br>
<br>


For example, a company may ask a legal assistants on whether it would be better to start a shop online or as a brick and mortar, based upon the current existing laws and to consider what laws are likely to change in the future.

<br>
<br>


Legal assistants are not supposed be with you during a trial, such would be illegal. It is also illegal for a legal assistant to give any advice on any legal investigation.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Laws to start the society with</b> 


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


The process of changing and creating laws has been mentioned previously in this document. However, laws will need to exist when the new society is created and therefore it is up to the founders to decide on th
initial laws that the new society will start with.


<br>
<br>


However, below exists a blue print for some of such laws. It can be
decided by the founders whether or not to add these recommended laws.

<br>
<br>


1) there exists no minimum wage (Market forces determine wages. People get a basic living wage, regardless of how much they live on and regardlesson whether or not they are unable to find work)


<br>
<br>


2) trade unions are banned. This is because they prevent competition
between employees and employers

<br>
<br>


3) hire/fire policy exist. Businesses can hire/fire anyone as they see fit and employees can start a job or leave a job as they see fit. The only limitation is the agreement of notice stated in the contract. That agreement, by law, needs to be the same for employers and employees.


<br>
<br>



Employers and employees legally need to have the same time period to
give notice. Notices can legally range from no notice to 30 [Ukku
day]s. It is illegal to make a requirement of a leave notice to be
longer than 30 [Ukku day]s.


<br>
<br>


4) people/companies legally can employ anyone locally or internationally but then they need to have the same rights and responsibility as someone employed locally. 

<br>
<br>


For example, they need to work the same hours as someones would work in the [Land of Ukku] or if laws exists against green house gases then factories overseas cannot legally produce the green houses that are restricted. This is to ensure that competition for employment remains free and fair.

<br>
<br>


5) shift work is illegal. Employers can only employ someone based on the time worked, and cannot have them on call for when they may work or may not. Someone needs to be payed based on their time agreed, not based on time rosters. 

<br>
<br>


If you want an employee to be flexible for the whole week, you need to pay them for working the whole week (which is illegal because you cannot employ someone for a whole week without giving them breaks). This is regardless of whether or not they were working. 

<br>
<br>


This not only prevents social problems but it also allows for competition to exist. People are able to engage the job market or even start a business of their own, without being committed/restricted to/by a single employer.

<br>
<br>


6) marriage does not legally exist as a legal concept. Instead marriedindividuals are married purely by social significance. Legally, no
difference exist between non married people and married people

<br>
<br>


7) gambling is illegal with the exception of competitions

<br>
<br>


competitions are defined as any activity where you compete (as opposedto luck) and where there is only one prize for the winner. In the event of ties, this winning prize may not be divided up and either one needs to continue to find a winner or no price must be giving at the end.
<br>
<br>


Informal betting is allowed however, but there is no legal
responsibility to hold one to keep up to their word. No third party must be involved in order for the bet to be considered informal

<br>
<br>


8) no transportation machinery is allowed to have an open blade. For
example, the blade of a boat needs to have a cage around it to be
considered safe. This is to prevent any person/animal from being killed by the blade

<br>
<br>


9) there is no legal age limit to start earning money. Anyone of any age, is legally allowed to start working for money

<br>
<br>


10) All forms of air pollution are banned. That means that normal cars are banned and one needs another power source for them: such as electricity.

<br>
<br>


It also means that things like barn fires, barbecues etc require
specific permission beforehand. This is done to protect people from
fumes polluting the air

<br>
<br>


11) It is illegal to have a contract forcing an employee not to reveal any trade secretes of a company or to keep secrete any information (with the exception of confidential client information)

<br>
<br>


12) It is illegal to expose confidential customer information/persona
information with the 1 exception stated below.

<br>
<br>


Such information can be exposed in an event where not doing so would be hiding information of a law that is broken

<br>
<br>


13) Death note wishes, are not sufficient to pass down inheritance. Instead, inheritances needs to be formally registered with the [Ukku
government]. 


<br>
<br>


If it is not registered, then it isn't legal. In such cases, then all property of that person immediately becomes the property of the state. These are used as a sink hole (the concept of how sink holes function is described later in the document, as to explain howmoney is created and how it is kept stable by sink holes)

<br>
<br>


14) death taxes/inheritance taxes are illegal. All wealth passed down cannot be taxed (the state needs to ensure that people receive money from theeconomy based on the value they provide. Therefore, wealth
redistribution must be avoided. The systems put in place need to be the thing ensuring that people can engage in the economy, regardless of
their background. 

Therefore wealth will be distributed equally. To redistribute wealth is to simple enable the existence of, a system that is designed to create inequality)


<br>
<br>


15) a contract cannot have any effects after termination of the contract. i.e it is illegal for an employer to require, in a contract, anything from an employee, after they have served their notice. This applies to the employer as well, as contracts cannot legally require anything from them after termination, either.

<br>
<br>


16) it is illegal for a contract to exist for longer than 900 days. Within 900 days, it needs to be renewed to be continued.

<br>
<br>


17) cannot make a contract that determines how one should act in theirpersonal live (e.g. not to post Nazi memes on twitter or not date people during their employment time)


<br>
<br>


18) a contract becomes null and void, if it requires that you sign another contract, in order to enforce it. For example, if you sign a contract but will be working in a building that will require you to sign 
separate contract, in order to be allowed into that building.


<br>
<br>


In such cases, everything needs to be in one contract, to both allow you to work and to also allow you to enter the building. Therefore, yo
would sign the contract with both being agreed to, in the same contract


<br>
<br>


19) all products must have an ingredient list, not just food. For example, if you buy a car it must have an ingredient list of the material used to make it. This must be available to anyone on request.

<br>
<br>


Services also need to have an ingredient list available on request. For example, for a cleaner, cleaning products are made from certain
ingredients

<br>
<br>


If the service work is virtual this does not apply. For example, if you have a freelancer account, you don't need to make a record that you used a scratch book for your work.

<br>
<br>


20) if the price of an item in a shop or online is not clearly labeled, or is the incorrect price, then the customer is allowed to take the item, free of charge

<br>
<br>


21) network marketing is illegal. You can get commission for bringing people into a company but only when they pay and there cannot be any increase in commission for you buying the product yourself. Pyramid schemes are illegal

<br>
<br>


22) fractal reserve banking is illegal, as offering someone money without actually having the money yourself, is seen as a form of debt. Since all debt is illegal, this is illegal

<br>
<br>


23) in an area, there is a limit to how high a building is allowed to be build ,compared to it's neighbors (as to make efficient use of space).

<br>
<br>


If more space is needed, they are not allowed to break this height limitbut instead may build down into the ground to any depth (assuming that they do not create danger for anyone in the area, by doing so) may increase the neighboring buildings height and make a bridge extension, as to make it all part of the same building foot paths should exist on top of buildings, so that people can walk around from building to building and get the fresh air from a height

<br>
<br>


All office buildings are only allowed to have a third of their space
used for offices, a third needs to be used as public spaces, e.g.
restaurants parks etc and a third of their space needs to be used for
residential living. Whether they rent out the space to someone else t
do it or do it themselves, is entirely up to the company


<br>
<br>


The way this height limits work, is that it starts at 1 story above the house and then when enough buildings in a designated area are 1 story high, then it becomes a 2 story area (the old footpaths on the roof
remain, but now just link buildings together without access to the fresh air and new footpaths, walks ways and roads need to be build on thestory above that).


<br>
<br>


The story limit increases as the height of the buildings around it
increases (the idea is to keep all the buildings at the same level an
allows one to look into the distance of a busy city and see a clear path with no buildings in the way)

<br>
<br>


The zoning of areas need to be balanced. Large suburbs, malls etc are
not to be desired. Instead, there must be a mix of different building
zones (e.g. residential, shops etc) in each area.


<br>
<br>


24) anti-monopoly laws must be put in place

<br>
<br>


25) along with anti-monopoly laws, there should be laws designed to assist the growth of smaller competition. Money must go to giving smaller businesses the chance to help themselves, as opposed to helping themdirectly.


<br>
<br>


For example, there may be strict rules determining how bigger companies are allowed to advertise unless they get a license to do so. The money for that license, needs to go to small businesses, that they are only allowed to use it for advertising purposes.


<br>
<br>


A good ratio may be for, 50% of the money to be spent on big business
marketing and 50% on assisting small businesses with marketing.

<br>
<br>


The specific laws are not important. What is more important however, is to ensure that competition exists, from smaller companies

<br>
<br>


26) it is completely legal for one company to criticise another.

<br>
<br>


27) price targeting is to be banned. One should never be charged a price that is different from the price another person is charged, for the same product/service. However, certain exceptions can be made based on practicality. 


<br>
<br>


For example, an insurance company may charge a higher price to smokers than non-smokers or you may offer a service to your friend at a lower cost. It is up to the new society to consider what to include and exclude for these exceptions. However, changing the price based upon different income brackets should never be allowed.

<br>
<br>


28) it is legal to buy external currency and bring it into the country. This includes currencies from other countries (e.g. euros) and includes other non official currencies (e.g. bitcoin)


<br>
<br>


An exception is made however for gambling and MLM's/phonzi schemes,
since both are illegal (regardless of whether they use a currency or
not)

<br> 
<br> 

<p style="font-size: 27px;">

<b>Tax<

</p>
</b>

<br> 
<br> 
<br> 
    

<b>   Internal vs external currency</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


In the [Land of Ukku] there exists two different currencies. The
internal currency and the external currency.

<br>
<br>


Both of these cannot be printed or destroyed at will, but instead are
pegged to the the amount of people that represent it. The more people
there are, the more money there is and the less people there are, the
less money there is.

<br>
<br>


<b>   External currency</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


To ensure that this currency does indeed have value, it is required that all goods (good not services) exported and imported out of the [Land of Ukku], will need to be payed in this currency.


<br>
<br>


Every time someone gets citizenship (by birth or other means) and are
older than 4500 (5*900) [Ukku day]s, they will be giving a certain
amount of the external currency. The state (to be split evenly betweenthe three [Ukku government]s) will receive the same amount of externalcurrency that they receive.


<br>
<br>


When the [Land of Ukku] first comes into existence, it will start by
having 9 million amounts of the external currency to begin, with each
[Ukku government] having 3 million, and 9 million will be created, to
be bought by private buyers straight away, at market prices.

<br>
<br>


The first 50'000 people to get such citizenship, will receive 90 amount each, and the state will receive 90 per each person.

<br>
<br>


The next 5'00'000 people to get such citizenship, will receive 18
each, and the state will receive 18 per person.

<br>
<br>


The next 1'000'000 people to get such citizenship, will receive 3
each, and the state will receive 3, per person.

<br>
<br>


Anyone who gets citizenship after that, will receive 1 each, and the
state will receive 1 per person.

<br>
<br>


There are no sink holes for this currency. To put simple, it experiences a gradual inflation with time.

<br>
<br>


<b>   The internal currency:</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


It is illegal to buy externally with this currency, as this currency is intended to be used, only inside the country itself. Since this currency is only digital, it is easy to keep track of. If any foreign holder is caught owning the currency, this will be removed from them and destroyed as to compensate for 'sink hole fees'. (sink hole fees are explained later in the document)

<br>
<br>


Other substitute currencies may be used in the [Land of Ukku], but
since all taxes require that one spends it in this currency, it will
always be the most sort out currency. This makes it the de facto currency.

<br>
<br>


Like with external currency, every 1 created to be giving to a citizen, there is another one, created to be giving to the state. However, unlike with external currency, the state is not free to do with this currency as it wishes. This other amount cannot be used by the state but instead must be used to promote IP infrastructure.

<br>
<br>



One internal currency amount is giving to the first 50'000 people, at
the moment they get citizenship if they are older than 4500 (5*900)
[Ukku day]s. This money will later need to be removed by sink hole
fees.

<br>
<br>


For the first 900 people, they will also receive another 1 amount, after 900 [Ukku day]s, after citizenship (900 [Ukku day]s after receivin
the first payment). The first 30 people will receive another amount
after the first 11'800 (900*2) [Ukku day]s. Again all of these need
to be adjusted for using sink hole fees.

<br>
<br>


This is extra cash that is giving to the new citizens as a means to
ensure that there is enough currency in the market, to get the currency started. It is only a temporary concession after the founding of the[Land of Ukku].


<br>
<br>



Each person is entitled to a payment of 1 unit of this currency every
4'500 (5*900) [Ukku day]s after being born or gaining citizenship:
as well as for every 4'500 [Ukku day]s, for the rest of their lives,
they are entitled to this payment.


<br>
<br>


Every 5 km apart there needs to be at least one building allocated to
the purpose of providing people with this money. The people have to
arrive, in person, and provide photographic proof, to ensure that theyare alive and that money is not being paid out to a dead person.


<br>
<br>


The amount of money they receive is the 1 unit of extra currency
created, as well as as any extra money they are entitled to from the
property tax fees (this is explained further later in the document).

<br>
<br>


To prevent inflation, their is a 'Sink Hole' fee that needs to be paidoff. This is paid by flexible income, i.e. business revenue and property tax. Should their be a great decrease in population, inflation is likely to occur and therefore more income from the property tax. Therefore, the risk of the state being unable to repay the 'Sink Hole Fees' seem unlikely.

<br>
<br>


The 'Sink Hole Fee' has two intended purposes

<br>
<br>


1) remove the amount of money created, thrush keeping the currency more or less stable

<br>
<br>


2) create a minor deflation as to encourage saving in the culture and
discourage reckless short sighted investments.

<br>
<br>


All currency received by the 'Sink Hole fee' needs to be destroyed.

<br>
<br>


The goal for deflation is that in 32400 (900*36) [Ukku day]s the
value of the money must be 50% more (e.g. 1 will become 1.5). If you do the maths for an increased rate of compound interest, this accounts for an interest rate of roughly 0.45% per year (normal year not based on [Ukku days]). 

<br>
<br>


So the sink hole needs to destroy all the money created during the life of the person once they have died plus 0.45% more per year (obviously years are not used, for measurements will be based on 900 [Ukku day]s).


<br>
<br>


Another thing to keep in mind is that despite the fact that the currency made, is pegged to the population, complete stability cannot be ensured.

<br>
<br>


In the real world, it may not work out that the currency becomes 50%
more valuable after 32'400 [Ukku day]s. That is just something to
keep in mind.


<br>
<br>


To prevent death creating big changes in the monetary supply, the 'sink hole' removal is based on each payment that was received by the person, during their life time. 

<br>
<br>


It happens every 4'500 (5*900) [Ukku day]ssince the last payment and pays back each payment that was paid to theperson, until everything is repaid.

<br>
<br>


If a person does not collect a payment, the money is put aside. If
later, that persons collects the next payment, then the person will
receive both amounts on their next payment.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Intellectual property funding</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


When 1 unit of internal currency is created and giving to a person, anequal amount is put, into a pot of money intended to fund IP.


<br>
<br>


In the [Land of Ukku], content restrictions and patents do not exist.
You cannot stop anyone from copying your work or building a machine
using your design (the only exception to this is a brands name.)


<br>
<br>


However, there is a part of the [national site] that keeps track of
all content and the more people get the content from the [national
site] or a link to the [national site], the more points the content
producers get. 


<br>
<br>


Users are encouraged to use the [national site] or to use another site that links views to the [national site], as to support the content creators. Video streaming sites are encouraged to have such a link build into them, as to support artists when people watch a video.

<br>
<br>


The money from this pot is spread out as a fraction of the total number of points out there, to the total number of points received by that
artist.

<br>
<br>


Content that is created from old content (despite the fact that it
cannot be restricted) needs that part of the original content producers points.

<br>
<br>


The points will be split 50/50 and this happens until their representation for their content expires. If someone then uses your work, the original owner still get 40% and you get 30% and then they get 30%. If someone uses their work then they get 30% and original owner gets 40% and the new person gets 30%.

<br>
<br>


Only when the content expires for the original owner, do you become the original owner.

<br>
<br>


All content licenses last 32'400 (900*36) [Ukku day]s and are treated
as a good that can be bought or sold. For example, someone can buy your right to content points and you can pass it on to someone else when you die.

<br>
<br>


Not all IP is created equally. For example, a movie may take more money to make than a song. To find a medical drug will take more money than to make a new device to clean kitchens.

<br>
<br>


This decision to how IP is divided down, will be decided by the [Ukku
parliament]. For example, a separate division for songs than music, and a separate division for patterns. 
<br>
<br>


This is to stop a million songs
diluting the value of something more expensive, like a movie. (external IP holders still receive points and the money, if they register their IP.

<br>
<br>


However, they need to spend their money inside the [Land of Ukku], since the currency may not leave the country. They may use it to buy products/services without needing to physically travel there or could buy external currency to send back to them).

<br>
<br>


Agents/companies cannot get more than 50% of the points from content
produced, by the ones who actually produced the thing in question.

<br>
<br>


 <b>   Stealing of Intellectual property by other nations</b>

<br>
<br>


With normal IP laws, bad behavior is rewarded. Other nations who do not have laws restricting the use of intellectual property, can use the
intellectual property from other nations who do. 


<br>
<br>


This means that the nations who spend time and money to develop them, will be restricted to a government enforced monopoly and will suffer as a result of this. 

<br>
<br>


On the other hand, the other nations that contributed nothing to the Intellectual property involved, will be able to use it freely, without any governmental monopoly being put in place.

<br>
<br>


The only means to try to enforce these IP laws is, for larger countries to try and bully smaller countries into giving in to accept their laws.


<br>
<br>

This can be damaging to the countries reputation, as this can be seen as imperialistic and also runs the risk of ruining the relationship with the country they are bulling. Other smaller countries, which they may have good relations with, will become cautious of them. 


<br>
<br>



Such behavior also encourages the government (of the country doing the bullying) to bemore authoritarian in policy, both with the policy they enforce within the country, and the policy they enforce on other nations.


<br>
<br>


In sharp contrasts to this, the type of 'point based' intellectual
property system, that will exist in the [Land of Ukku], allows for
intellectual property to be viewed as public infrastructure. Like all
public infrastructure, roads, light houses, etc, the public is free t
make use of them. 


<br>
<br>


The public decides how much money is contributing to them. If the country feels that intellectual property is less important, they can enforce a policy to put a break to it's creation.


<br>
<br>

If another country trades with your country, and uses a lighthouse in a harbor, they are not 'stealing' anything from you. Other countries are not restricted in their use of the intellectual property created in the [Land of Ukku]. 


<br>
<br>


Any such behavior will simple result in the culture and influences of the [Land of Ukku] becoming dominate in the other country, that is unwilling to/unable to, invest in any intellectual property infrastructure of it's own. 


<br>
<br>


Therefore, intellectual property becomes the soft power needed to both control other nations and to
spread the ideals of the nation. All of which, is done without harmingthe relationships that exist. If anything, it may leave people with more positive feelings of the [Land of Ukku]. This bias works in favor for the [Land of Ukku].


<br>
<br>


This is especially true when it comes to intellectual property involved with patents. All intellectual property is designed with the target
market (the ones who contribute money to it) in mind. All intellectua
property involving patents will be geared to solving problems existin
for the citizens of the [Land of Ukku]. 


<br>
<br>


The more discovery happens in
the [Land of Ukku] as to create these patents, the more the country
builds a name for it's self. Others will travel to the nation (or assist those in the nation) to solve the problems related to the target market in mind. In short, it allows others nations to spend their time and money to assist with the needs of the [Land of Ukku].


<br>
<br>


<b>   The press and Intellectual property</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Any citizen has a right to become a member of their local [non
governmental club] (the one's that exist in a region by default) and
then become a reporter.

<br>
<br>


In order for an international company to receive IP payment off their
work they first need to go employ
5 such reporters in a any local [non governmental club] and that
person must be able to engage in reporting news.


<br>
<br>


This is to stop biases from news companies. Like with any company, themain objective is not to expose the truth, but to make profits. It is
therefore important to allow for a more open discussing.


<br>
<br>


<b>   Revenue </b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


There are two ways in which the state gets revenue


<br>
<br>


1. by creating businesses/running investments

<br>
<br>


2. by taxation

<br>
<br>


<b>   Types of taxes</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


There are no income taxes, or taxes based on earnings in anyway. Ther
are only 4 types of taxes

<br>
<br>


1) property tax (which is paid for owning a property, the main source
of income for the state)

<br>
<br>


2) license fee

<br>
<br>


these are taxes that are paid to have a license for something. All money from these need to go to the thing in question. For example, you may require a license to hunt and all that money from the license must go topreserving wetland

<br>
<br>


3) innovation tax

<br>
<br>


the purpose of this tax is to encourage innovation/development by
mitigating for some of the damages to society caused by it. For example, let's assume that a new technology replaces workers in a field and the companies now spend 20% less on the salaries they would have payed to the workers. 


<br>
<br>


Lets also assume the costs to change is minimal to the company. The old workers of the job will receive 5% of this margin for nothing, whether they find another job or not. They will receive this for the rest of their lives and this can be passed down once to one other person (for example, a wife) after they die.


<br>
<br>



 After that it cannot be passed down to anyone else. 5% will be paid to the state to only be used for research into further ways to increase innovation. 5% will be
giving to the company as to only be used to look into further ways to
increase innovation and 5% will be giving back to the company to use as they see fit

<br>
<br>


This prevents time and energy being wasted to try and legislate away
progress.

<br>
<br>


4) sin tax

<br>
<br>


Sin tax includes anything from vat on unhealthy products, such as sugar to import/export ratio sin tax, to ethics involved with producing a
product or service, etc. For example, do the factories overseas pollute the environment

<br>
<br>


There also exists a point based system for companies, for which if they get sinned taxed, they get points behind their name. This means that an company that does business with them (buys from them or sells to them) will get points for doing so and will be taxed as well. A company may get negative points to shield them against this. 

<br>
<br>


They will get negative points by doing something good for society. For example, creating a recycling centre for the public to use free of charge or by doing business with a company that is high in negative points.

<br>
<br>


There are 5 different kinds of points, if you have negative points in 1 area, that does not protect you from the other 4 area (these points are intended not for the [Ukku government]s to start regulating the
businesses but to get the businesses into the habit of regulating
themselves)


<br>
<br>


1. being environmental (e.g. global warming, smoke/fumes, virus
creation, putting harmful chemicals to people's drinking water etc)


<br>
<br>


2. ethics (not breaking the law, not engaging in devious behavior, notdesigning your product to break after time so customers buy more, having clear labels so customers know what is in the product and having clear quality testing labels from third body so customers know the quality of the product before they buy it etc)

<br>
<br>


3. economic stability (exports vs imports, having the same land used
for 24/7 and not closed during the day, etc)

<br>
<br>


4. happiness (both for the 
customer and the employees. Are 
employees overweight, does food 
contain harmful sugar for 
customers, having bridges between 
public buildings to allow for 
them to be more accessible, 
making sure your building is used 
24/7 by you ,or run out ofhours 
by another business etc)



<br>
<br>


5. promoting competition/a competitive environment (e.g. not doing
monopolistic practices, investing in mechanisms that will allow othersto do the same business, no mater how small they are (for example, a
cellphone company allowing anybody to pay to have access to their
cellphone towers to start a cellphone business), giving free
marketing/selling to platforms to small businesses that wish to compete against them one day, do employees of your company also work in another company as well (i.e. have two jobs) etc.

<br>
<br>


6. Economic Transparency (seeing expenses, value chain, mark up on each product, etc) rule 5 applies to both competition for customers and for employees (i.e ensuring that competition is created to ensure customers have more options of who to buy from. More competition for employees means that employees can demand more from their employers, as otherwise they can just find another job.

<br>
<br>


The money taxed from each type must go directly into improving that typ of problem. For example, when taxing a big company on for not allowing growth for competition, the money must be used for the following two

<br>
<br>


1) ensuring that companies do not score low points in the 5th point
(ensuring competition exist)

<br>
<br>


2) paying to develop the competition of the punished company.


<br>
<br>


<b>   How property taxes work</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Property taxes are strange because the amount of property tax that
exists is not decided by the [Ukku government]s or the [Ukku
government] or anyone else for that matter. Instead it is determined only by market forces.

<br>
<br>


Everybody who owns land will pay a tax for owning it. The amount that it is taxed at will be determined by the value of the land. Each land is divided into 900m by 900m sectioned squares where the roads for cars surround it. The value of the land will be determined by the value of the land in that 900 by 900 area, plus the medium value of all the other 8 lands 900m by 900m squares that surround it, dived by 9. By including the land around it, it makes it more difficult to cheat while still sticking to roughly the value of the land in question.


<br>
<br>


The value of these squares will be determined by a combination of rentalprices and prices that property in those units are bought/sold at. How you will process such data to give a single number, is something that will need to be tried and tested during the founding of the [Land of Ukku], until the right formal is found.


<br>
<br>


From this, the land can get points for each land in question of how much tax is payable for each portion of land. How much pointsis something needs, is to be tested during the founding of the [Land of Ukku] until the right amount is discover.

<br>
<br>


Once the right figures are known, then it is expected that this is notto be changed. The amounts must be consistent as to create stability an to prevent politicians changing them to suit political agendas.


<br>
<br>


Keep in mind that some miner glitches may be found in this system and
their may be a few tweaks needed to get it working. For example, what
happens when some jerk decides to buy a house in a cheap area for a much greater value than it is actually worth, just so the rental tax in the area can go up.


<br>
<br>


The value of the land will need to be re-adjusted for every 300 [Ukku
day]s.


<br>
<br>

<p style="font-size: 27px;">


<b>Spending of taxes

</p>
</b>


<br>
<br>
<br>

    

<b>   The three types of governmental revenue</b> 

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


There are three types of governmental revenue when received by tax

<br>
<br>


1) savings tax revenue

<br>
<br>


This is savings that can be used later, hence saving up for a rainy day.

<br>
<br>


2) fixed tax revenue

<br>
<br>


This is allocated for a specific purpose and cannot be used for anythingelse. For example, a sin tax for smoking needs to be used to stop
smoking, and cannot be used for anything else.

<br>
<br>


3) flexible tax revenue

<br>
<br>


This is revenue that can be used freely how the state wishes, as thereis no specific purpose giving for it.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Flexible revenue</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>



All Flexible revenue needs to be further divided, e.g. policing,
cleaning, education etc. and the percentages that each get needs to b
determines before hand. One department cannot take money that is
allocated to another department. 


<br>
<br>


There exists an 'other' department
that is truly general spending in it's true sense. This department
allows for spending for the unexpected. However, the amount of money
that must go to this department, must be kept very small.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Sink hole fees</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


All sink hole fees needs to be paid off. Up to 50% of all flexible
income must go towards paying off this fee [if amount is greater than
50%, then the rest is to be paid back later as internal debt.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Savings</b> 


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


The state is not allowed to borrow money and cannot allow it's self toget into debt. For this reason their needs to be sufficient savings.
Savings always need to be 100% of the current income for a year. 

<br>
<br>


If the are not, (e.g. the income raises for that year) then their is at least 50% of all flexible tax revenue [after the sink hole fee as been removed] that needs to be used for savings)

<br>
<br>


<b>   Public events/festivals</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


After the sink holes and savings have been accounted for, there needs t be 5% of the left overs set aside for public events. For example, public music concerts, camping events, markets, etc. This is to keep th
economy running and improve people's livelihoods.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Revenue driveled from businesses and investment</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


1) 50% must go back into further investments or businesses

<br>
<br>


2) 50% is flexible revenue

<br>
<br>


<b>   Breakdown of different revenu</b>


<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


1) property tax

<br>
<br>


This tax is either flexible, savings or fixed revenue, the percentage of is decided based on what the government decides.

<br>
<br>


However, the percentage above needs to be determined beforehand based ondata and predictions. The state cannot change these amounts as it
pleases, when ever it feels like doing so.

<br>
<br>


2) license Fee

<br>
<br>


The revenue received from this needs to be either fixed tax revenue (theidea being to support the area the licensing is taken place in) or
savings revenue. No more than 50% of the license fee, is allowed to gointo savings.

<br>
<br>


3) innovation tax

<br>
<br>


All innovation tax is fixed by nature and there are clear unambiguous
rules of when to use it and when not to use it. The rules for how the
money of this tax needs to be spent, is also clear and unambiguous.


<br>
<br>


4) sin tax


<br>
<br>


All sin tax needs to fixed tax revenue and must go directly towards
stopping the problem that is 'the sin' that needs to be resolved.

<br>
<br>


Departments may borrow internally (for example, education borrowing fro public health's money) and funds may be borrowed between different
revenues (for example, flexible taxation being borrowed from license fe income). 


<br>
<br>


However, borrowing is only expected to take place in exceptional circumstances and is not intended to become the norm.

<br>
<br>


All money borrowed must be paid back, however no mark up is allowed (th money being paid back must be the same as the amount originally borrowedat).

<br>
<br>

<p style="font-size: 27px;">


<b>Public services

</p>
</b>

<br>
<br>
<br>

    
<b>   Public parks</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


The [Land of Ukku] has public parks (both outdoor and indoor). In
these parks you will find things such as public gym equipment, public
seating and free delivery to order food/products from the shops and
restaurants in the area, free football fields etc.


<br>
<br>


The idea is to offer public parks with free services and free public
infrastructure to the public. This can allow for people to interact/bepart of their local community and therefore remove social problems. 

<br>
<br>



Some of these parks may in-fact 'break even' when considering the costs created by negative social problems.


<br>
<br>

What public services/infrastructure parks offer will depend on the park in question and will depend on the decisions made by the [Ukku
government]s and [Ukku parliament]


<br>
<br>


<b>   The legal defacing of public buildings</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


In theory, all public buildings in the [Land of Ukku] belong to the
people and not the state. The state simply has the responsibility to
maintain it on behalf of the public. In reality however, this idea is
someone abstract.

<br>
<br>
 

However, to incorporate this concept as a metaphor in a tangible way,
anyone from the public is allowed to do art, graffiti, stickers, drawings, etc onto public buildings (buildings belonging to the state.) This is a right that they have and this right cannot be denied. This also allows for citizens to show discontent and challenge ideas.


<br>
<br>


However, there is some limitations to this. Work displaying pornography or extreme violence, or gross concepts, will not be allowed and those who do so, will either get a warning or will be prosecuted.

<br>
<br>


If any of the above keeps occurring and creates too great of a social
problem, the state has the right to require that people then need to
first inform the state of what they will be drawing. Only after they
have been giving permission, will they be allowed to do it. This wouldbe intended to be used in places where things have gotten out of hand.

<br>
<br>


Exceptions may also be made for certain places where graffiti may
prevent functionality (e.g. for visually impaired people) or where it is essential for the beauty and experience of an object. For example, a glass bridge would be ruined if graffiti started covering up the glass.


<br>
<br>


Due to the above, it is clear that the defacing of any roads or road
signs is illegal, as it disrupts the functional purpose of the road.


<br>
<br>


<b>   Free internet</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


There are concerns in regards to the internet. The internet may have
inefficient protection against bugs, may have requirements that do notprotect [fantasy computing], or may require an additional language to
be learned, (e.g. English instead the [Ukku language]) in order to
work with it. 


<br>
<br>



Another concern is the possibility of other countries
using access to it as a political weapon. For example, if the InternetCorporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) becomes corrupted.


<br>
<br>


However, it is expected that the internet would be preferable to an
intranet. If it is decided that an intranet is preferred to be used
instead of the Internet, then anything accessible on the wider internet must also be accessible in the intranet as well.


<br>
<br>


The internet (or intranet if chosen) needs to be made publicly
accessible to everyone in the [Land of Ukku], as a right. However,
this may prove to be expensive. In order to cut costs, they may put
certain restrictions on this internet to cut such costs. For example,
making another internet that is only used for text and other low data
means. For things like videos, music etc, one will need to pay for
normal internet.


<br>
<br>


However, if the cost allow it, the ideal would be to have any content on the internet freely available to the public. It is important to note that this document was created with a person who has only limited knowledge of how computers work and function. This is particularly true for networks.


<br>
<br>


It is also important to take note that when stating that an intranet
will need to ensure that anything that is accessible on the internet is accessible on the intranet as well, it does not go into much clarity of what is meant by 'anything'. This is done due to a lack of understanding of the how the IT part works. 

<br>
<br>


However, things like websites, search engines, etc, need to be accessible via such an intranet, if it would exist.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Free health care and emergency services</b> 


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Health care and emergency services, such as fire fighters, police,
courts, etc, are completely free to the public to access. To what exten these services function and what is to be included, is purely determine by how much state funding exists.


<br>
<br>


<b>   Public transportation and division of land in the [Land of Ukku]</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


All public transportation is free in the [Land of Ukku]. The cost and
quality of such infrastructure again is purely determined by how much
state funding exists. However, anyone needs to be able to travel to any other part of the [Land of Ukku] for free.


<br>
<br>


Public areas are divided into zones.

<br>
<br>


Zone 1


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


100 by 100 meter squares that allows for people to walk inside them.
Buildings exist within these blocks as well

<br>
<br>


Zone 2

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


There exists two types of roads between these 100 meter squares. It ispossible that a property/building may be greater in size than 100 meter squares and therefore these roads may run through public/private
property or buildings. These roads are not for cars.

<br>
<br>


The first road is for cyclists, electric scooters, etc, only. The second road is for joggers, skaters, roller blades, etc, only

<br>
<br>


Zone 3

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


900m by 900m squares meter squares exist for all roads for cars.


<br>
<br>


Zone 4

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

This is a much larger zone to travel long distances in the country

<br>
<br>


Zone 5


<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


This is intended for travel between other countries. Roads are designed so that you never need to stop during a journey.

<br>
<br>


There are no stop streets, roundabouts or traffic lights in the [Land
of Ukku] as roads never cross each other. All roads are one way roads.
<br>
<br>


If you need to turn right, you move towards the right of the road and
then at the next turn, turn right. If you wish to make a U-turn you will need to turn right twice. If you wish to turn left you will need to turnright 3 times.

<br>
<br>


None of the roads of different zones mix. For example, bridges will bebuilt above car roads as to allow pedestrians to cross. Bridges over carroads will allow for cycle roads to to travel over them. This ensures that less accidents occur and saves time by allowing for traffic to
move more freely.

<br>
<br>


Free public transport exists from zone 2, 3 and 4. You would need to
first travel via zone 4 if traveling long distances, then take anothertransportation means for zone 3 and take another transportation means
for zone 2. 

<br>
<br>


This ensures that public transport is more organised and therefore can operate at a lower cost. It also ensures that public transport needs to do less stops between points.

<br>
<br>


<b>   [governmental assisted living program]</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


In the [Land of Ukku] every citizen has the right to housing. The
extent that this benefit includes is purely determined by cost and what the [Ukku government]s and [Ukku parliament] decide on. 

<br>
<br>


However, most likely these housing units will have a net positive on the economy and will be low cost hostel units.

<br>
<br>


Each person has a right to a sound proof quite bed for sleeping and also have somewhere where they can store their stuff. With the appropriate size of such storage being the size of a large suitcase. They also
should have the right to a communal shower area, bathroom, and kitchenarea.

<br>
<br>


The area must be kept clean and all those in these facilities must be
giving the right to participate in the cleanness and maintenance of
these facilities.

<br>
<br>


To ensure that these facilities do not attract unhealthy living
conditions, a community must be build within these hostels, between all the members living there.

<br>
<br>


Any person has the right to these. This is regardless of age and a
reason does not need to be explained. If a child chooses to live in one of these, there may be extra facilities there to aid their healthy
development into a responsible adult and to fight against any social
stigma that may occur due to this. 

<br>
<br>


The fact that no reason is needed,
allows for people living in unhealthy environments, to have an escape
without any consequences for doing so.


<br>
<br>


For example, a child experiencin
an abusive relationship can leave without needing to prove that such
abuse has taken place or needing to justify their actions. Those in
domestic abusive relationships would be able to do the same.

<br>
<br>


Being homeless is a crime, however. People who do not have a home of
their own, are required to live in these facilities.

<br>

<b>Education

</p>
</b>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>   Why education is important</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


The purpose of the education system is to get people to the point where they will be be able to get money for themselves. Anything else that is learned, comes secondary to this goal. Secondary purposes include
preparing them for society, teaching them to contribute to their
community and self improvement.

<br>
<br>



<b>   How students are prepared</b>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


Gradual steps are taken. The line between finished education and non
finished educating is blurred. Even after education, adults may go back and forth between work and education, to learn further skills.

<br>
<br>


What is to be avoided is for any large leaps/graduations, to show a
beginning of a new stage of life. Instead of expecting that they firstfinish their studies and then look for work, looking for work becomes
part of their studies. During their time in the education system, theywill be expected to be working and earning money for themselves.


<br>
<br>


Even if students are still children, they get paid for the work they do as part of their education. Please note that the students receive the payment and not the legal guardian. For the legal guardian to attempt to take this money, would be considered theft. It would legally be treated the same way as anyone else trying to steal such money.

<br>
<br>


<b>   How teachers teach</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


There exists no teachers in the education system. Instead there only
exists facilitators. 

<br>
<br>


Their job is to facilitate the teaching nenvironment. The students learn from other students ahead of them, who re-teach the information they previously learned. 


<br>
<br>


This helps to them remember what they learned and they build essential skills in the process. Their facilitators may offer corrections during this process or may even step in and teach temporarily, if it is felt to be necessary incertain circumstances.


<br>
<br>


<b>   How facilitators are to ensure learning occurs</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Facilitators are not free to do as they wish inside the classroom.
Instead they are required to ensure that students are educated by onlychoosing one of the following approaches.


<br>
<br>


1) approaches that do not have an expected answer for the students

<br>
<br>


1. open discussions

<br>
<br>


This doesn't have any correct answers. Instead the point is to hear the views from others and then they can start discussing them, in an open and respectful manner.


<br>
<br>


This can sometimes be a green hat session, where the class together
tries to think of ideas.

<br>
<br>


2. open debate

<br>
<br>


This is similar to an open discussion, but while an open disusion doe
allow for debate, the main purpose of an open discussions is to hear
everyone's views. 


<br>
<br>


The purpose of an open debate is to allow people to challenge each other's beliefs. Students may be required to research before hand. They may also be asked to stop during a debate, to go research more before, continuing again at an agreed later stage.

<br>
<br>


3. doing actives

<br>
<br>


This entails doing something. For example, needing to research, doing anassignment. etc.

<br>
<br>


They may also use this time for memory yechniques, such as using AI to write 5000 word analysis between two countries as to help assist the memory needed to remember diffrent countries. Or to ask AI to write about the likelyhood of Nebraska declaring independance from the USA, to learn/remember that Nebraska exists.

<br>
<br>


2) this also includes the time students take on work to earn money, during their studies. Approaches that do have an expected answer for the students

<br>
<br>


1. result driving learning

<br>
<br>


The students will be giving a problem, which they are required to solve or giving a question which they will need to research for the answers.

<br>
<br>


Then afterwards, they present it to the class or send it to the
facilitator as an assignment. Afterwards, the previous students gives
them the correct answer.


<br>
<br>


2. tests for learning

<br>
<br>


Without studying the topic beforehand or without being taught about the topic, students are giving a test to do. Then the previous students go over the correct answers with the current students, as they mark i
together, with the correct answers giving when wrong.


<br>
<br>


3. presentations

<br>
<br>



The previous students do a presentation to teach the current students a subject. During which, facilitators have the right to step in to point out mistakes/give extra information and may also comment about the
presentation style it's self. For example, the facilitator may ask th
previous students to talk in a manner that is less boring, as not to
bore the audience.

<br>
<br>


4. green hat sessions

<br>
<br>


The previous students ask the current class a question/questions and
then after a few ideas are suggested, the correct answer is giving.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Remembering and retaining information learned</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


To ensure that students remember what is learned, facilitators can use
<br>
<br>


the following techniques

<br>
<br>


1) repetition

<br>
<br>


One only truly learns by repetition. The more one repeats the things
they learn, the better they learn them. Things learned will be repeated many times, in different ways. Something learned in one subject will be repeated across multiple subjects. 

<br>
<br>


This is done to ensure that the topiis drilled inside their heads, as opposed to being forgotten as soon as they start another subject. For example, in art class they may need to paint the cell. 

<br>
<br>


Labeling all it's parts and describing the function of those parts. Another possible example may be that during football practice, they will get extra points for working with a formula they learned in maths.


<br>
<br>


2) test

<br>
<br>


Unlike with tests for learning, these tests are actually designed to
test the knowledge of a student in something that they have already beentaught before. There exist 2 types of the test

<br>
<br>


1. where the results of the test do not matter

<br>
<br>


These are used by facilitators, to determined what areas need to be
focused on when teaching, and what teaching methods work better.

<br>
<br>


2. where the result of the test determine whether the student passes or fails the test

<br>
<br>


In reality a student can never fail. Instead students are simply 'not
yet passed'. They will need to keep writing the test, until they pass.

<br>
<br>


The facilitators have the right to change the questions during a
re-write, to determine if the students truly learned something. 

<br>
<br>


These tests will be marked by previous students, with each test needing to be marked by at least 5 different previous students. This is to ensure accuracy and to increase repetition. Facilitators mark some of these test, at random, to double check their accuracy. 


<br>
<br>


Facilitators will look into and remark any tests, where the results differ greatly between, their marking and the marking done by the previous students.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Practical application to what is learned</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Anything that is learned that can be applied practically, should be done so. 

<br>
<br>


For example, if students are taught techniques to help organise
their time, then they must be giving activities, tasks etc: where the
can use what they have learned, in order to plan the completion of a
task, within a time frame.


<br>
<br>


<b>   The three divisions of education</b>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>



Education can be divided into three types. The type is determined by who owns it.

<br>
<br>


1) owned by the [Ukku government] or [Ukku parliament]


<br>
<br>


This education is taught in facilities owned and funded by the [Ukku
government] or [Ukku parliament]. Most of these should be free for
students to use, but some may require a fee for students.


<br>
<br>


2) owned privately

<br>
<br>


This education is taught and owned by a third party. Most of these will likely be companies, but can range from anything from NGO's to foreign countries.

<br>
<br>


This education may sometimes be hosted within the same buildings ownedby the [Ukku government] or [Ukku parliament], for the first type of
education.

<br>
<br>


3) owned by [non governmental club]s


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Money is giving out by either the [Ukku government] or [Ukku
parliament], to be used for [non governmental club]s, designed to
assist education. Despite being partly of fully funded by the [Ukku
government] or [Ukku parliament], the education is not owned by
[Ukku government] or [Ukku parliament].

<br>
<br>

<b>   Class size</b>


<br>
<br>



<br>
<br>


Classes are big. For example, hundreds if not thousands of people, in a class. Smaller classes do not necessaril lead to better teaching
environments, as long as those who need help, are able to get it.

<br>
<br>


Classes will normally have 3 to 4 facilitators in these large classes
They keep things in control and provide extra help if needed. 


<br>
<br>


Students who need help, may be sent to get extra help outside of the lesson, in their incompetence proves to be a burden on the other students. 

<br>
<br>


Everyone has the right to learn and nobody must take that away from anyone else. If students fail to recognise their impact on other students, then the facilitates must make them understand. Choosing to be ignorant is not anappropriate option at expense of the group.


<br>
<br>


Class sizes are determined by practicality (For example, if it's too fa to expect learners to travel, then it would be more practical to split up the same class in different locations, as to be closer to where they live.) and popularity of the class in question (there are some things that may be less popular/more niche. Therefore classes will be smaller because less students chose to study them.)


<br>
<br>


<b>   Who is allowed in the classroom during teaching</b>



<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


In theory, anyone is allowed in a class as there are no class size
limits. This means that parents can go to classes. In fact, they are
encouraged to do so. As with other things in the [Land of Ukku]
transparency is essential. It is important for people to observe freely,how their fellow citizens are taught during their education.


<br>
<br>


This also creates the environment, that allows people to form a
community around people of different ages. They aren't isolated to
people their own age. This creates a more decent social circle and
removes the social problems that comes without this community element.

<br>
<br>


In reality, some restrictions may be made due to class size limits (even if people stand up, there are still limits to a room capacity) and dueto safety reasons. For example, someone who poses a danger, to the
people in the building, may be asked to leave.



<br>
<br>



In theory, competency and interest should be what determines what
[subject] and [lesson] a person does. An adult should be fine to
learn in the same environment as a child.

<br>
<br>


While this may be true for some niche areas of learning (where only few people wish to learn the topic in hand) in reality kids are painful. It is unlikely that adults would agree to learn in the same facility as them. 


<br>
<br>


Therefore, it is likely that some divisions, would be made for learning. How they wish to go about such a separation and to what extent, will need to be done and tested and determined by the society it's self.


<br>
<br>


It should also be noted, that people with mental disabilities, are also painful. For this reason, their may be some measures, put in place, to separate them from the rest. This is to be done, even if they have no impact on people's ability to learn. 


<br>
<br>


Their presence, is all it takes,
to disturb the other members of the class. Unlike a traditional classroom, students are expected to learn and then teach, the next students. Try imagining, a situation where someone wouldn't feel uncomfortable, being taught by a 12 year old or someone with down syndrome.


<br>
<br>


<b>   Personal relationships between facilitators and students</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Facilitators are neither rewarded or punished for having personal
relationships with students. The only responsibility of facilitators is, to ensure that learning is taking place correctly. 


<br>
<br>


Any relationshipshould be judged by, how the laws and the society would determine such a relationship between people (considering the age difference as well) to be. The facilitator/student dynamic, shouldn't be what determines the value of such relationships. 


<br>
<br>


Due to the fact that students are never marked, can never fail (just repeat something until they pass), and the fact complete transparency exist in the classroom, any abuse of power doesn't exist. In short, facilitators do not have the power over students to take advantage of them.

<br>
<br>


Most importantly however, any risk of child abuse (especially those of sexual nature) are unlikely to occur, while other adults are in the
room. As with the home environment, transparency prevents what would
have otherwise, have happened, when closed doors exist.

<br>
<br>


<b>   The subjects in the [Land of Ukku]</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Unlike with the traditional model of education (where students start
their studies by following an inflexible, compulsory ,curriculum. 


<br>
<br>


Onlylater are they be allowed more freedom as to which paths they wish to specialize in) in the [Land of Ukku], the start of the education is determined by small short courses, which they are free to choose andexperiment in. Only later, after having experienced different areas, are they giving the option to narrow it down and have a more focused
curriculum. 


<br>
<br>


These smaller courses can range from anything from physical
hand crafting activities (such as wood working, welding, etc) to
theoretical applications (such as philosophy, history of Rome, etc).


<br>
<br>


They may need to travel to another school during the day, to get to
another course. However, due to the fact that transportation is free,
that shouldn't be a problem.
Despite the freedom to choose to study as they wish, the following is
compulsory:


<br>
<br>


<b>   All compulsory [subject]s (and what is covered in them) are shown below.</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


1) computers

<br>
<br>


-they need to learn [fantasy computing] (the meaning of the term
[fantasy computing] has been explained previously in this document).


<br>
<br>


Therefore they will need to understand coding, know how to code and have an understanding of how computer hardware and software works, be able to use the [fantasy operating system], reprogram commands for this
operating system to their wishes, etc.


<br>
<br>

-using only scrap metal, they must create basic binary computers

<br>
<br>


-using only scrap metal, they must create computing components (e.g.
mouse, joy stick, etc) that can be plugged into any computer and be usedas an external device for that computer.

<br>
<br>


2) creative creation


<br>
<br>


This subject is meant to allow learners to practice their creative
skills and produce something out of there own creativity.


<br>
<br>


-learners would be giving the freedom to create whatever they desire
giving a certain theme (e.g. to represent the facts they learned
yesterday about computer science in a creative way)

<br>
<br>


-intended to teach them skills to produce/create work and then allow
them to produce something creative with it. (e.g. teach them to paint
and then to allow them to start painting)

5) maths

<br>
<br>


-what one would learn traditionally in a maths class. Such as algebra,trigonometry, geometry, etc

<br>
<br>


-different diminutions of lines and how they are used to make their own shapes, as well as learning how to deal with shapes in different
dimensions

<br>
<br>


-i and unreal numbers

<br>
<br>


-are not taught to use bod mas or any irregular method that is likely tocreate confusion


<br>
<br>


-are taught that the standard for all formulas is to make them equal to zero (e.g. not zx+y buy 0x+y-z)

<br>
<br>


-to convert and work with different base/raddix number systems


<br>
<br>


-real world applications of maths (e.g. there are 5 boxes and two
chickens in each box, how many chickens are their in total)

<br>
<br>


6) the [Ukku Language]

<br>
<br>


-all rules of grammar that exist in the [Ukku Language]

<br>
<br>


-all official non-chainging words in the [Ukku Language] 

<br>
<br>


-how to write good essays, to have reading comprehension etc

<br>
<br>


-the [Ukku Langauge] has two ways of repersenting numbers. One way is the 'click' sound based system and the other way is a convertion of normal words into numbers. For example, 579 might be hotel. They students need to learn this system for remembering large numbers (e.g. 15 digit number) as to convert them into simple sentences "the hotel driver lost the monster shoe". 


<br>
<br>


Then they can use theis system to deal with startistic and calculations dealing with excessively large numbers and also to make sence of factual reports that make use of many numbers (as can be seen for example in the sectiopn of this document describing how the [Ukku goverment]s and Ukku parliament] work)


<br>
<br>



-the [Ukku Language] in different senses (the [Ukku Language] is
normal spoken and listened to and therefore is normally auditory.
However, the language can be represented in other senses as well [I.e
smell, touch, sight etc]. 


<br>
<br>



They need to learn how they work, how to read them and how they are written. Each other sense has it's own script to be writing in)


<br>
<br>

how to think in the senses of the script you are reading, e.g. for
smell you supposed to smell the senses of the language as you read thescript for smelling


<br>
<br>


7) thinking board games

<br>
<br>



-to play thinking board games like chess, go, Sudoku etc or get them to solve problems/puzzles

<br>
<br>


-get them to create their own board games or their own problems/puzzles


<br>
<br>


8) time management and organisation

<br>
<br>


-techniques to better manage your time

<br>
<br>


-how to be more organised, as to be able to quickly find what they arelooking for

<br>
<br>


-how to create work that is organised for others (so they can find information easily)

<br>
<br>


-how to find information quickly in another person's work

<br>
<br>


-how to have focus and prioritising what to focus on

<br>
<br>


-learn from others as well, discuss what works and doesn't work, and
work as a team to set their own deadlines and stick to these deadlines

<br>
<br>


9) working

<br>
<br>


-allowing learners to look for work and to start working and teaching
them/assisting them along the way

<br>
<br>


<b>   All compulsory [lesson]s (and what is covered in them) are shownbelow.</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


1) challenging

<br>
<br>


to challenge people mentally. For example, reading upside down, writing upside down, doing arithmetic in one's head, remembering large amounts of numbers, multitasking, etc
(there is no pass or fail, but the learner are encouraged to challeng
themselves)

<br>
<br>


2) cleanliness

<br>
<br>


-basic hygiene


<br>
<br>


-food safety

<br>
<br>


-how to clean yourself


<br>
<br>


-how to wash after going to the toilet


<br>
<br>


-experts advice about germs and how they multiply

<br>
<br>


-why we get sick and how to get sick less often

<br>
<br>


-how to help someone who has fallen ill


<br>
<br>


3) cognitive biases


<br>
<br>


-what one's do we have


<br>
<br>


-how to compensate/prepare yourself for them

<br>
<br>


-like those shown in the 'Thinking, Fast and Slow' book

<br>
<br>


-to see how advertisers/adverts manipulate you, how to be aware of that
and how not to be manipulated by it
<br>
<br>


4) confidence building

<br>
<br>


-singing/dancing/public speaking, acting and other socially
uncomfortable things, to get learners to be less shy/awkward around
others and to be more confident doing these in public. Apart from
building conference, it also has an economic impact, as people may
produce work in such arts they learned to do, during their studies

<br>
<br>


5) dimensions


<br>
<br>


-students are taught to think in the third dimension by blind folding
them, and getting them to feel objects. Afterwards they need to picture them in their heads and then are asked questions on these objects, to see if they are doing it right
 once they are able to think in the third dimension, they are encouraged to think in the fourth dimension. 

<br>
<br>



This is done by thinking about the difference between how we see in the second dimension, with only a
perspective of depth of the third dimension. 

<br>
<br>



They apply such 4th dimensional depth, while thinking in the third dimension, as to get a grasp of the fourth dimension. They are encouraged to think in higher dimensions if they wish. They may be offered tests on shapes of these higher dimensions, if they wish


<br>
<br>


6) emergencies

<br>
<br>


-common emergencies and what to do e.g. fire, earth quake, robbery, etc

<br>
<br>


-regardless of whatever age any person has, they right to leave the
family and choose to live in the [governmental assisted living
program]. 


<br>
<br>


They aren't obligated to give any reason why they chose to
move. They have this right regardless of their circumstances. They will be taught the process of how to move in to a [governmental assisted
living program] if they choose.


<br>
<br>


-what to do when you see someone tries to bribe you (e.g. when someonetries to persuade you, saying they helped you before and need you to
help them, etc)


<br>
<br>


7) in depth sex education

<br>
<br>


-what sex is. They taught an explanation in full detail, so that they
understands what it is, what happens during sex and what biologically
happens in the body during sex.

<br>
<br>


-what sex feels like, the feeling people have before engaging in it and what feelings cause people to engage in it. 

<br>
<br>


The parents present in the classroom and facilitators, are encouraged to open up about their own experiences, as to have an open and healthy disusing about sex. Discussing sex in terms of relationships, intimacy vs non intimacy, etc


<br>
<br>


-how to satisfy someone sexually, e.g. When to kiss someone, etc

<br>
<br>


-dangers/risks involving sex, how to handle sex responsibly and how tohave mature conversations about it.

<br>
<br>


-puberty and other sexual important bodily functions one needs to knowabout, e.g. periods, erections, facial hair, etc

<br>
<br>



-how the students themselves feel about it. They encouraged not to take the one extreme, of being too immature around the conversation, but not to take the other extreme, of feeling shame or embarrassment, around thesubject. Instead, it is supposed to be a mature, healthy, discussion


<br>
<br>


-how sex/marriage/relationships/pornography, etc are approached by
different cultures throughout history

<br>
<br>


-having an open discussing about people's views and to have a respectfuldebate/disagreement discussing where people disagree with each other. This conversation should focus on why they disagree


<br>
<br>


8) [Land of Ukku] laws


<br>
<br>


-how to check them, how the country works, etc

<br>
<br>


-how the government spends its money and the [national site] one can

<b>   In addition to the above</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


In addition to all of the above compulsory [lessons] and [subjects],
students need to do at least 3 non compulsory [subjects] and every 900[Ukku day]s need to do at least 5 non compulsory [lessons].


<br>
<br>


One thing that should be noted is, what's shown above, are shown as ifthey are taught in separate categories. However, in reality, the manner in which they will be taught will not be so clear cut. 

<br>
<br>


Due to the fact that people learn best through repetition, courses are designed to incorporate many different topics into one. For example, you could do a speech on time management to the class and then be asked to identify the parts of speech present in your speech. 

<br>
<br>


You could have a sport game
where after scoring a goal, your team receives an extra point for being able to complete a maths calculation. It is clear that this kind of
'mixing' of activities is silly. None the less, it's both effective increating the repetition needed for learning, and it creates engagement.

<br>
<br>


A fun class is a class of learning. You can bring a horse to water butif one doesn't want to learn, it will choose not to.

<br>
<br>

 
<b>   School days</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


School days are long but their is no home work giving. How long the
school day will be, would be determined by what subjects one wishes todo.

<br>
<br>


School days are (1 hour after sleep and 1 hour before) 18 hours long.
Which 18 hours they do their leaning in, depends on which subjects they choose. However, this time includes sport/exercise and other creative activities, to break up the day.

<br>
<br>


Also, not all of this day will be for working. Students choose subjects they take and therefore choose how much they wish to work for. Learners are required to only do the [subject]s and [lesson]s required to
them. Anything else is optional. 

<br>
<br>


This gives the learners the ability to choose how much or how little, they wish to do. It helps them grow into people who can determine for themselves, what is important for them.

<br>
<br>


Their are 3 times for essential [subject]s and [lesson]s, due to the
3 time zones.

<br>
<br>


There are also no breaks times specified in the education, as breaks
exist between classes. These breaks can either be used to have time t
travel to other classes (if a class is in another location), for hanging out with friends or for whatever they wish to use it for.

<br>
<br>


<b>   Presentations</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


All presentations from students are expected to start in the followingorder. This is the format used to teach the new students. The studentswill be taught how to present like this and are expected to do it.


<br>
<br>


1) mention the objectives of why you doing the presentation/what you hope that doing the presentation will achieve

<br>
<br>


2) list the sufferings on the [basic desire sheet] that these objective fall under (it may be beneficial, to have a picture of the [basic
desire sheet] while you do this


<br>
<br>


3) state the background/context of everything

<br>
<br>


4) ask for input from the class, as to if they agree with that the
objectives and sufferings listed by you. What recommendations do they
have for you

<br>
<br>


5) explain what it is you will be doing (e.g. explaining in a presentation why more trees need to be planting in the north of cities, as opposed to the south of cities)

<br>
<br>


6) ask the class for input, if they feel this is the best way to go about it. What recommendations do they have for you

<br>
<br>


7) start the presentation

<b>   Constant revolution and reform

</p>
</b>


<br>
<br>
<br>
    

<b>   Constant revolution</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Following on the belief that, political technology political systems
need to be improved upon by a constant process and that as soon as
systems are put in place, the systems will resist any progress made tothese systems: built into the foundation of the [Land of Ukku] is an
idea of constant revolutions. This is intended to aid progress. 

<br>
<br>


Any society that exists as a breaks away from the [Land of Ukku], may ormay not have this ideal. However, in the [Land of Ukku] it's self,
this is a fundamental part of the new society. 

<br>
<br>


Instead of deciding a how society is to be functioned, instead a platform needs to be created. This platform must allow the society to develop in a purely transparent
manner and must allow the society to destroy its self.


<br>
<br>


 A system designedwith the purpose of it's own destruction, ensures that systems are put in place to aid progress: as opposed to resisting it. 

<br>
<br>


Unlike with conventional revolutions, where the objective of running a new system and creating a new system is different: the idea behind the [Land of Ukku] is to ensure that political change is a fundamental part of that existing system. Before one change ends, another changewould have already began.

<br>
<br>


There are two things to take note of, however


<br>
<br>


1) when political change is referred to, it means to be able to change the fundamental political systems it's self. A democracy may change it's leader or political party, but no real change has occurred. 

<br>
<br>


Even in absolute dictatorships, true power lies in the hands of the masses. Perhaps the only significant difference between dictatorships and oligarchies vs modern day democracies, is in the transparency of
institutions and the encouragement of the public to participate in thepolitical process.

<br>
<br>


2) when referring to constant political revolution, one is not referring to revolutions of violence. Instead a revolution exists within the system it's self. The society constantly reforms it's self, without the need of violence. Violence is the result of what happens when things go wrong.

<br>
<br>


<b>   The question of consistency and stability</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


Change is bad. The hard reality is that any attempt to implement a newsociety, will be viewed as unstable, by those in the international
community.


<br>
<br>


This is not to any fault of their own. Any new state lacks the historyneeded to prove it's own credibility. The [Land of Ukku] not only willbe a new state, but a state that works fundamentally differently to any other country in existence or that has existed previously. 


<br>
<br>


Distrust for this new society and it's institutions, can only be further guaranteed, by the fact that, no final resolution exists for the state.


<br>
<br>


By it's nature, it is a constantly changing entity, as one revelation occurs, before the previous one can be finalised.


<br>
<br>


The [Land of Ukku] will need to accept this disregard as a constant
reality. The state has a responsibility to its citizens, to work around the restrictions imposed by such a hostile international community.

<br>
<br>


However with time, confidence in the state, will be based on things mor substantial. The way a society gains confidence, is by creating order. A process of constant political revolution, creates chaos. 

<br>
<br>


In order to mitigate against this chaos, their needs to be strong existing systems that do not drastically change. This is regardless of what political situations occur internally. Businesses need to be able to make long term decision with confidence. 


<br>
<br>


If laws may be changed, without prior notice, it will create panic.
Therefore, if the [Land of Ukku] learns how to improve on it's systems, without creating disruption: then the international community will reward it with trade and business. However if it fails, then the international community will punish it, until it finally learns.


<br>
<br>


    
<b>   Measures put in place to ensure stability in a changing political system</b>


<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


In order to insure stability, this document has listed some structuresto be followed. These consist of rules, and the behavior of the rulers(i.e. the ideology of how the country must be lead).


<br>
<br>


This is not to be taken as absolute truth. It is only the frame work
needed, to grow out of. Changes may occur. However, the duration of
these changes are to be slow, as to allow the society time to adapt. 


<br>
<br>


As old norms are replaced, their replacement should be slowed, as to
prevent disruption from occurring. It should also allow for small testing areas to be done. 

<br>
<br>


This is done to test the impact of changes on a small scale, before chainging are made for all of the society. Unlike doing a Brexit, a Brightan-it is better to be done as a test.

<br>
<br>


<b>   The first revolution</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


With the creation of the [Land of Ukku] comes the need to start the
revolution. 


<br>
<br>


The first goal of the the [Ukku government] and [Ukku
Parliament] is to get the country up and running, to ensure that the
country and government is organised by the rules and structures
mentioned in this document, to ensure the [non governmental club]s ar
in place with public participation, to ensure public participation in
society and freedoms are met, to ensure accountability of officials tothe public, and to ensure that infrastructure is of a sufficient
standard to function effectively.


<br>
<br>


After that, they can start the process of setting up a revolution. 

<br>
<br>


There are 13 steps in this process

<br>
<br>


1) [Ukku Parliament] to agree on deadlines for each of the following
stages of the revolution below


<br>
<br>


2) [Ukku Parliament] needs to set up public debates and discussions, to discuss suggestions of how the [Land of Ukku] is to evolve and to get participating from the [non governmental club coalition]s (who decide to participate) to participate in the mater as well.

<br>
<br>


3) from these talks, proposals are made by the [Ukku Parliament] and th [non governmental club coalition]s who decide to participate. The
final decision of which of these to include and not to include, is
decided by the [Ukku Parliament]


<br>
<br>


4) together with [non governmental club coalition]s who decide to
participate and the public, [Ukku Parliament] plan how tests for each
will be done, where they will be done and when they will be done.

<br>
<br>


Both [Ukku Parliament] and [non governmental club coalition]s have
to be in agreement

<br>
<br>


5) together with [non governmental club coalition]s who decide to
participate and the public, [Ukku Parliament] imperilment these test.
They have to strictly follow the rules that have been agreed on beforehand to test these

<br>
<br>


Both Parliament and [non governmental club coalition]s have to be in
agreement


<br>
<br>


6) together with [non governmental club coalition]s who decide to
participate and the public, [Ukku Parliament] decides which system to
choose or a hybrid system if need be. Also they decide if any
improvements are needed.

<br>
<br>


Both Parliament and [non governmental club coalition]s have to be in
agreement

<br>
<br>


7) together with [non governmental club coalition]s who decide to
participate and the public, [Ukku Parliament] decide if further
testing is needed. 


<br>
<br>


If so, they also need to justify why they are needed. Both Parliament and [non governmental club coalition]s have to be in agreement

<br>
<br>



8) if further steps are needed, then it goes back to step 4. However, if no further tests are needed, then they can proceed.

<br>
<br>


Together with [non governmental club coalition]s who decide to
participate and the public, [Ukku Parliament] creates rules/steps to
follow to implement/transition into the new system and also sets
deadlines for each step

<br>
<br>


Both Parliament and [non governmental club coalition]s have to be in
agreement

<br>
<br>


9) new government/parliament is created to replace the old one. However it has no political power yet.


<br>
<br>


10) the new government/parliament set deadlines for the next revolution by consulting the public, [non governmental club coalition]s and the oldgovernment/parliament. The final decision is determined by the newgovernment/parliament

<br>
<br>


11) based upon the steps agreed to beforehand, the new government/parliament start gaining more and more responsibilities of the new society, until they finally have replaced the old government. 

<br>
<br>


However, true power at this stage still lies with the old government to step in at any point, should things get out of hand.

<br>
<br>



12) the new government/parliament needs to set up public debates and
discussions to discuss suggestions on how the [Land of Ukku] should
evolve and to get participating from the [non governmental club
coalition]s (who decide to participate) to participate in the mater aswell.

<br>
<br>


13) from these talks, proposals are made by the [Ukku Parliament] and the [non governmental club coalition]s who decide to participate.

<br>
<br>


Both the new government/parliament and [non governmental club
coalition]s have to be in agreement
<br>
<br>


14) after step 13 the old government/parliament loses all political power and must be dissolved. It is not even allowed to remain as a figurehead,with no political power. It needs to be removed entirely.

<br>
<br>


In order to ensure that the above works effectively, transparency,
public participation and public accountability needs to be ensured. 


<br>
<br>


Tomitigate the risk of abuse of power from either the [Ukku Parliament] or the [non governmental club coalition]s, the public can use the
threat of the right to self determination or in more serious situations,the threat to [initiate a revolution]. Both of these are discussed
below in the document.

<br>
<br>


It should also be noted that, it is deliberate that the meaning of theterm 'both Parliament and [non governmental club coalition]s have to
be in agreement' is vague. It is not clear as to what classifies as
agreement. 


<br>
<br>


In cases of deadlock, there may be a need to create some mor
specif measure of determining this. However, the idea is to encourage
open discussion and cooperation, as opposed to obsessing about some
technicality of getting more votes, of whatever finalises the decision.


<br>
<br>


<b>   Official country/state list</b>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


It is the job of [Ukku parliament] to create and maintain a list of
all countries (independent territory's with the ability to make and
enforce their own laws) and states (cities, states etc, territory's
within the jurisdiction of another territory that can still make and
enforce different/extra laws, than the main territory they exist in)
that exist within the world. 



<br>
<br>



For example, Germany would be classified as a country, while California would be classified as a state within a country. 

<br>
<br>


California isn't a country but is able to make it's own laws and decisions. Therefore, under certain circumstances, the state may find it beneficial to do intentional relations, directly with California, as opposed to the country in which it exists in.

<br>
<br>

<b>   The right for sovereign territory to be sold</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


The [Land of Ukku] has the right to sell it's sovereign territory to
any of the recognised countries and states mentioned on the list above.


<br>
<br>

If a country/state is not on this list, then the [Land of Ukku] cannotlegally sell it's sovereign land to them.


<br>
<br>

Negotiations take place between the 3 [Ukku government]s and the
state/country wishing to buy the land. They will lay down their feelings about what is happening. Only once all three of them agree to proceed, can the process for selling land, officially begin. The process has 9 stages, listed below.

<br>
<br>


Stage 1

<br>
<br>


[Ukku parliament] and the country/state in question negotiate a price.
<br>
<br>


If a price is reached, then this goes to stage 2.

<br>
<br>


Stage 2

<br>
<br>


All three governments need to agree on the settled price, otherwise they go back to stage one.

<br>
<br>


Stage 3

<br>
<br>


An awareness campaign is done to ensure that the general public is fully aware of what is happening. Public debates and discussions are held on the issue.


<br>
<br>


Stage 4

<br>
<br>


A vote is done, where all [non governmental club coalition]s can
choose to opt into the vote. After the first vote another vote begins.

<br>
<br>


There needs to be 3 consecutive votes, with the same answer to move onfrom this stage. If any of the votes have a different result to the
previous votes, then the process starts again as the next vote will bemeasured as the first vote.


<br>
<br>


If the 3 consecutive votes are in favor, then it moves onto the next
stage. However, if the 3 consecutive votes are not in favor, then the
entire process is canceled.

<br>
<br>


Stage 5


<br>
<br>


All people who have owned land on the sovereign territory being sold
before the first stage of the official process and who still own that
land, can choose to opt in to vote.
<br>
<br>

 
If 75% or more of these people
agree, then the process moves ahead to the next step.  If less than 75% agree, then the entire process is canceled.

<br>
<br>


Stage 6

<br>
<br>


All citizens of the [Land of Ukku] (regardless of whether they live inthe [Land of Ukku] or have even been to it) can opt into a vote. Two
votes are held for this and the votes need to be at least 100 days apartfrom each other.

<br>
<br>



If 25% or more of voters in both votes agree, then the sovereign
territory is sold. However, if any one of those two votes has less than 25% of voters in favor of the change, then the whole process is
canceled.

<br>
<br>



All people who have owned land on the sovereign territory being sold,
before the first stage of the official process, and who still own thatland, have a right to become citizens of the new country in which the
state/country buying the land belongs to or to be able to live/work
freely in the state which the land is being sold to. If this conditio
cannot be met, then legally speaking, the land cannot be sold.

<br>
<br>


<b>   The right to self determination</b>


<br>
<br>

Due to the fact that sovereign territory can only be sold to a
pre-existing country, those who wish to break away from the [Land of
Ukku] cannot legally do it by buying land. However, there is another
legal way in which to break away from the main state.

<br>
<br>


Every [non governmental club] has the right to self determination. In
order to break away from the main country a club will be needed, either a pre-existing club or a new one needs to be created.

<br>
<br>


The next step is purely financial, one needs to pay for 3 costs

<br>
<br>


1. the land needs to be paid for (bought like any normal citizen would buy private land)

<br>
<br>


2. the infrastructure around that land needs to be payed for. The costwould be double the cost of that infrastructure. They also need to payfor the value of the land it's self.


<br>
<br>


They can opt out of this cost but then all the public land belongs to
the [Land of Ukku] and distribution of their land is only within the
land they bought. For example, roads existing within their territory,
will belong to the [Land of Ukku] as part of the sovereign territory
of the [Land of Ukku].


<br>
<br>


3. they need to pay for the taxes that would be received on the land which they own. In order to do this they have two options. The first would be to expand the territorial borders of Ukku with land of equal or greater
value. 

<br>
<br>


Hence give land to Ukku where the current tax is equal. The second however would be to give to the [Land of Ukku] real-estate from outside the [Land of Ukku], that is currently generating 30 times or more the value in rental income, of what that tax for this initial land is.

<br>
<br>


They can temporarily or permanently opt out of this by, still paying th governmental tax on this land after independence. 

<br>
<br>


However, this wil mean that they wouldn't truly be independent, as the [Land of Ukku] has the right to take the land from them, if they ever stop paying this tax. At any point however, they can become fully independent by the 2 methods.


<br>
<br>

The value of this land is determined by either the value it was when
independence was declared or of the medium of it's neighbor's land, (th land surrounding the new state). 

<br>
<br>


The greater one of these two would be taken as the value. This is to prevent people declaring independence as a means to avoid taxes.

<br>
<br>


Even after independence, all resources, gold, water, wind, sun light,
etc belong to the [Land of Ukku], and not to the newly formed state.
It is only by further agreements between both parties, that the new
state can gain full access to it's own resources. 

<br>
<br>


However, in all other means, the land is independent. Once the [Land of Ukku] has granted the newly formed state the ability to use it's own resources, then the [Land of Ukku] no longer has access to them.

<br>
<br>

The costs to be paid back for Independence is the standard but is not a absolute. If the [Land of Ukku] decides to grant grace to the new
state, they might write off expenses that need to be paid back for
independence or settle for a lower amount. However, transparency needsto exist and public debate. Without these, the grace for self
determination can be used by the state as a means to implement
corruption.

<br>
<br>


To ensure stability in the newly created state, full independence cannothappen straight away. Instead the following steps need to taken

<br>
<br>


first 90 [Ukku day]s of existing, the society has the right to it's
own government (if it even has one). This government may have
international relations like any government would.

<br>
<br>


second 90 [Ukku day]s has the ability to collect it's own taxes

<br>
<br>


third 90 [Ukku day]s has the ability to make it's own laws on top of
already existing laws. No new laws made in the [Land of Ukku] apply,
only the old ones set before the state declared independence.

<br>
<br>


fourth 90 [Ukku day]s has the ability to choose to not follow the law
in the [Land of Ukku] and will not need to pay any taxes (except the
property tax if not completely paid off)

<br>
<br>


firth 90 days can enforce it's own laws. At this point is either fullyindependent or (independence being determined by whenever it is willing to pay off it's property tax)

<br>
<br>


At any point, the new state can be canceled and go back to being part o the [Land of Ukku], except when it is both fully independent and it
has fully paid off it's property tax. Then the [Land of Ukku] has no
legal obligation to retake the land back, as it's own.

<br>
<br>



<b>What happens when systems fail: the outbreak of violence</b>

<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>


If all the rules above are to be followed, then all should be fine.
Citizens have an option to start a new society of their own and have aprocess to follow to work towards, for such a new society. 

<br>
<br>


However, what happens when the state breaks the rules outlined above or commits to extreme acts of power abuse (e.g. commenting genocide)

<br>
<br>


To deal with this scenario, there exists an option to be carried out.
The outbreak of violence is what occurs when systems break down and
should always be used as a last resort. 

<br>
<br>


In theory, the threat of violence should be enough of a deterrent to prevent it from occurring. There exists two stages before complete violence occurs.

<br>
<br>


The first stage is where the opposing party list it's complaints with
the rulers and lists it's demands afterwards. 

<br>
<br>


For example, the [Ukku
Parliament] had acted illegally based on the rules governing the [Landof Ukku] and therefore they wish that they are replaced, or, an old
government may not want to give up power to the new government and
therefor they demand that they do so. Whatever the case is, this will
result in talks between the rulers and the opposing party. 

<br>
<br>


During these talks, the threats of violence exists, as a deterrent against inaction. The next stage will be to [initiate a revolution]. [initiate a revolution] is a formal process of violence that is intended to protect citizens from tyrannical rulers. 

<br>
<br>


Each citizen of the country has a
right, via online means, to attempt to [initiate a revolution]. In
order for an [initiate a revolution] to be successful, there needs to
be 1'800 people attempting to initiate it and they need to be within 30 meters distance from each other, while doing it. 

<br>
<br>



What this will do, is to allow all the [revolutionary equipment] allocated to them, to be used after 1 [Ukku day] after being activated. All the individuals who attempted to [initiate a revolution] will be public knowledge, accessible to anyone before an [initiate a revolution] occurs.

<br>
<br>


At this point, it is not intended for any violence to occurs. The prescience of armed forces is meant to be used as a deterrent and threat, as talks continue.

<br>
<br>


The next step would be for violence to occur but in a controlled manner.This is not suppose to happen but if violence needs to occur, it is best for rules to be laid down and agreed upon. 

<br>
<br>


These are to ensure basic human dignity. Such as not breaking international law, limiting casualties, not destroying infrastructure and limiting the impact on the economy, etc.

<br>
<br>


If attempts to control the violence prove unsuccessful, then
uncontrolled violence occurs. There are two stages of uncontrolled
violence.

<br>
<br>


The first one is based upon the objective that is being achieved. Therefore, all violence occurs in order to achieve the objective and is
expected to stop entirely once the objective is reached.

<br>
<br>


The second is the least desired stage. It only occurs once people loose track of the objective for using violence or once the objective has been reached but the violence still continues. This would be 'rock bottom.'

<br>
<br>


One can only hope that if this stage is ever reached, people will manag to eventually restore some order and end the pointless chaos. Until
order is restored with strong political systems, the risk of violence
re-occurring is likely. This is true even for times where it may appear unlikely to reoccur.

<br>


<b>>   [revolutionary training]</b>

<br>
<br>


<br>
<br>


[revolutionary training] is a 10 day program that occurs once every
900 [Ukku day]s. Attendance is compulsory, except for those who pay a
fee to gain a license, to be exempt from this training. The money theypay, must be spent on [revolutionary training], the process to
[initiate a revolution] and [revolutionary equipment].

As mentioned previously in the document, citizens need to give 20 [Ukku day]s out of 900 [Ukku day]s to the government, where the first is governmental training and the second is national service (e.g. police, etc). You can opt out of either one of these, but this requires that you pay a licens fee. 

<br>
<br>


The only [revolutionary training] that cannot be avoided by payment, is the one day course requered to gain citizenship, when not gained by birth.

<br>
<br>


All citizens have access to [revolutionary equipment]. [revolutionary
equipment] are weapons and defenses, that only function after an
attempt to [initiate a revolution] is successful. 

<br>
<br>


Even after an [initiate a revolution] is successful, there are limitations on these, to limit destruction. For example, each firearm requires two people, in order to use it, tanks require 45 people, in order to use it, etc. 


<br>
<br>


As a general rule, the more destructive a weapon, the more authorisation is needed to use it.

<br>
<br>


Each citizen must be giving a gun and armor for protection and they must bring this with them to their [revolutionary training]. 

<br>
<br>


In the [revolutionary training] they are taught the following

<br>
<br>


1) how to use [revolutionary equipment] while practicing in scenarios
applicable to the real world

<br>
<br>


2) where to find [revolutionary equipment] available to the public (e.g.tanks, plains, grenades, etc)

<br>
<br>


3) who in their community specialises in what [revolutionary equipment] and how to work together as a collective unit, to achieve the agree
upon desired goals

<br>
<br>


4) how to do the steps before [initiate a revolution] occurs

<br>
<br>


5) what reasons are legitimate reasons to [initiate a revolution] and
what are not

<br>
<br>


6) how to [initiate a revolution]
since any attempts to [initiate a revolution] are public, they are
taught their rights and the rights of others, in regards to attemptin
to initiate a revolution


<br>
<br>


7) other means of achieving their desired goals, e.g the right to selfdetermination, etc

<br>
<br>



8) how to protect each other from extremist who wish to [initiate a
revolution] for extremist reasons (such as Islamic extremists or communist organisations, wishing to replace the government)

<br>
<br>


9) to protect one's self against other emergency situations, war, famine, flooding, etc

<br>
<br>


10) how to [initiate a revolution] when another outside force tries t
attack the people living in the [Land of Ukku]

<br>
<br>


In order to protect against those abusing their power to [initiate a
revolution], a full [Ukku day] is required. During this time, other
citizens are warned of this and can [initiate a revolution] themselves. 


<br>
<br>


Then after that [Ukku day], all those who [initiate a revolution], will have access to [revolutionary equipment] at the same time. This is to prevent one group having access to it and using it against another group, that is defenseless.


<br>
<br>


The last thing that citizens are reminded of at the end of their [revolutionary training] is that, violence is not an ends to a means. Rather, it is a last resort for when all else fails. They are reminded that it should be avoided at all costs.
